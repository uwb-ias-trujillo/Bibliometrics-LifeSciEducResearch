Following the concept of a measurement system analysis (MSA), influencing factors of the probe tack test were investigated by a design of experiments (DoE) approach. A response surface design with 38 runs was built to evaluate the influence of detachment speed, dwell time, contact force, adhesive film thickness and API content on tack, determined as the maximum of the stress strain curve (sigma(max)). It could be shown that all investigated factors have a significant effect on the response and that the DoE approach allowed to detect two-factorial interactions between the dwell time, the contact force, the adhesive film thickness and the API content. Surprisingly, it was found that tack increases with decreasing and not with increasing adhesive film thickness.

Recently, Fletcher et al. confirmed that HIV patients on oral antiretroviral therapy had lower intracellular drug concentrations in lymph nodes than in blood. For instance, in the same patient, multiple lymph node drug concentrations were as much as 99 % lower than in blood. This study built upon our previous finding that HIV patients taking oral indinavir had 3-fold lower mononuclear cell drug concentrations in lymph nodes than in blood. As a result, an association between insufficient lymph node drug concentrations in cells and persistent viral replication has now been validated. Lymph node cells, particularly CD4 T lymphocytes, host HIV infection and persistence; CD4 T cell depletion in blood correlates with AIDS progression. With established drug targets to overcome drug insufficiency in lymphoid cells and tissues, we have developed and employed a ""Systems Approach"" to engineer multi-drug-incorporated particles for HIV treatment. The goal is to improve lymphatic HIV drug exposure to eliminate HIV drug insufficiency and disease progression. We found that nano-particulate drugs that absorb, transit, and retain in the lymphatic system after subcutaneous dosing improve intracellular lymphatic drug exposure and overcome HIV lymphatic drug insufficiency. The composition, physical properties, and stability of the drug nanoparticles contribute to the prolonged and enhanced drug exposure in lymphoid cells and tissues. In addition to overcoming lymphatic drug insufficiency and potentially reversing HIV infection, targeted drug nanoparticle properties may extend drug concentrations and enable the development of long-acting HIV drug therapy for enhanced patient compliance.","[Ho, Rodney J.

In this paper, a novel four-wheel-driven series-parallel hybrid electric powertrain is proposed. A motor is connected to the differential of the rear axle. An auxiliary power unit is linked to the differential of the front axle via a clutch. First, a mathematical model was established to evaluate the fuel-saving potential. A rule-based energy management algorithm was subsequently designed, and its working parameters were optimized. The hybrid powertrain system was applied to a transit bus, and the system characteristics were analyzed. Compared to an existing coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain, the fuel economy of the four-wheel-driven series-parallel hybrid powertrain can be at the same level under normal road conditions. However, the proposed four-wheel-driven series-parallel hybrid powertrain can recover braking energy more efficiently under road conditions with a low adhesive coefficient and can alleviate the torsional oscillation occurring at the existing coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain. Therefore, the four-wheel-driven series-parallel hybrid powertrain is a good solution for transit buses toward more robust performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the molecular mechanisms of CAD remain elusive. Regulatory pathways are known to play crucial roles in many pathogenic processes. Thus, inferring risk regulatory pathways is an important step toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying CAD. With advances in high-throughput data, we developed an integrated systems approach to identify CAD risk regulatory pathways and key regulators. Firstly, a CAD-related core subnetwork was identified from a curated transcription factor (TF) and microRNA (miRNA) regulatory network based on a random walk algorithm. Secondly, candidate risk regulatory pathways were extracted from the subnetwork by applying a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Then, risk regulatory pathways were prioritized based on multiple CAD-associated data sources. Finally, we also proposed a new measure to prioritize upstream regulators. We inferred that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) may be a key regulator in the dysregulation of risk regulatory pathways. This study takes a closer step than the identification of disease subnetworks or modules. From the risk regulatory pathways, we could understand the flow of regulatory information in the initiation and progression of the disease. Our approach helps to uncover its potential etiology. Key messages We developed an integrated systems approach to identify risk regulatory pathways. We proposed a new measure to prioritize the key regulators in CAD. PTEN may be a key regulator in dysregulation of the risk regulatory pathways.","[Zhang, Yan; Liu, Dianming; Wang, Shuyuan; Yu, Xuexin; Dai, Enyu; Liu, Xinyi; Jiang, Wei] Harbin Med Univ, Coll Bioinformat Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lihong] Harbin Med Univ, Inst Canc Prevent & Treatment, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Luo, Shanshun] Harbin Med Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Gerontol, Harbin, Peoples R China","Luo, SS (reprint author), Harbin Med Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Gerontol, Harbin, Peoples R China.",Luoss63@126.com; jiangwei@hrbmu.edu.cn,,,"Foundation for the National Natural Science Foundation of China [30900837, 81202074]; Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Harbin [2013RFQXJ057]; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China [QC2014C017]","This work was supported by the Foundation for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30900837, 81202074), the Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Harbin (2013RFQXJ057), and the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (QC2014C017).","Kohler S, 2008, AM J HUM GENET, V82, P949, DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.02.013; Safran M, 2002, BIOINFORMATICS, V18, P1542, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.11.1542; Pulikkan JA, 2010, BLOOD, V115, P1768, DOI 10.1182/blood-2009-08-240101; Wingender E, 2000, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V28, P316, DOI 10.1093/nar/28.1.316; Ebert MS, 2012, CELL, V149, P515, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.005; Hsu SD, 2011, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V39, pD163, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkq1107; Sengupta D, 2013, MOL BIOSYST, V9, P1360, DOI 10.1039/c3mb25518b; Fleissner F, 2010, CIRC RES, V107, P138, DOI 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.216770; Goh KI, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P8685, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0701361104; Wang J, 2012, BRIEF BIOINFORM, V13, P216, DOI 10.1093/bib/bbr041; Xiao FF, 2009, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V37, pD105, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkn851; Padmanabhan S, 2010, INDIAN J MED RES, V132, P567; Wang J, 2010, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V38, pD119, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkp803; Sarecka-Hujar B, 2009, CLIN EXP MED, V9, P117, DOI 10.1007/s10238-008-0022-0; Sethupathy P, 2006, RNA, V12, P192, DOI 10.1261/rna.2239606; Keller A, 2009, BIOINFORMATICS, V25, P2787, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp510; Shai I, 2006, OBESITY, V14, P2099, DOI 10.1038/oby.2006.245; Tusher VG, 2001, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V98, P5116, DOI 10.1073/pnas.091062498; Kanehisa M, 2000, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V28, P27, DOI 10.1093/nar/28.1.27; Jiang QH, 2009, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V37, pD98, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkn714; Minami Y, 2009, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V39, P359, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02110.x; Furgeson SB, 2010, CARDIOVASC RES, V86, P274, DOI 10.1093/cvr/cvp425; Weng GZ, 1999, SCIENCE, V284, P92, DOI 10.1126/science.284.5411.92; Tabuchi T, 2012, CLIN SCI, V123, P161, DOI 10.1042/CS20110563; Edgar R, 2002, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V30, P207, DOI 10.1093/nar/30.1.207; Le DH, 2011, BIOINFORMATICS, V27, P1113, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr082; Duan M, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0060170; Grayson BL, 2011, GENES IMMUN, V12, P341, DOI 10.1038/gene.2011.13; THOMAS R, 1995, B MATH BIOL, V57, P247, DOI 10.1007/BF02460618; Jia GH, 2009, J CELL MOL MED, V13, P547, DOI 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00384.x; Barabasi AL, 2011, NAT REV GENET, V12, P56, DOI 10.1038/nrg2918; Jiang W, 2013, BIOINFORMATICS, V29, P2596, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt423; Aerts S, 2006, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V24, P537, DOI 10.1038/nbt1203; Semenza GL, 2014, ANNU REV PHYSIOL, V76, P39, DOI 10.1146/annurev-physiol-021113-170322; Altun-Gultekin Z, 2001, DEVELOPMENT, V128, P1951; Dong X, 2013, J CELL BIOCHEM, V114, P174, DOI 10.1002/jcb.24315; Huang Y, 2007, BIOINFORMATICS, V23, pI222, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm222; Xu HY, 2008, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V395, P130, DOI 10.1016/j.cca.2008.06.004; Chu EC, 2004, MED SCI MONITOR, V10, pRA235; Dobrin R, 2009, GENOME BIOL, V10, DOI 10.1186/gb-2009-10-5-r55; Gragnoli C, 2011, CARDIOVASC DIABETOL, V10, DOI 10.1186/1475-2840-10-32; Ideker Trey, 2002, Bioinformatics, V18 Suppl 1, pS233; Kwon YK, 2007, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V8, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-8-384; Lu M, 2008, PLOS ONE, V3, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0003420; Nibbe RK, 2010, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000639; Pastrana JL, 2012, J CLIN EXP CARDIOL, V2012, P2, DOI DOI 10.4172/2155-9880.S12-002; Sarkozy M, 2013, CARDIOVASC DIABETOL, V12, DOI 10.1186/1475-2840-12-16; Sondermeijer BM, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0025946; Vlachos IS, 2012, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V40, pW498, DOI 10.1093/nar/gks494; Yanyan Li, 2012, Clin Cardiol, V35, P55, DOI 10.1002/clc.20972",50,0,1,5,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0946-2716,1432-1440,,J MOL MED,J.

However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.","[Whitehead, N.

Requirements are technical statements that inform system design, implementation, and integration. The meaning of requirements information is relevant to the SE problem. The requirements entropy framework (REF) implements the theory and accounts for the meaning of requirements information in terms of its cumulative quality. The requirements quality distribution reflects the cumulative quality and determines the requirements entropy, the number of possibilities, and the additional information needed to reach the desired end state. The desired end state is occupied by requirements having all specified quality attributes. The requirements entropy, uncertainty, and needed information decrease as engineering effort is input into the process. The impact of added, revised, and deleted requirements can be estimated or measured from the change in entropy, uncertainty, or information. Results from computer simulation experiments suggest that the REF is a useful method for monitoring requirements trends, forecasting when the desired end state will be reached, and estimating requirements engineering effort for system development programs.","[Grenn, Michael W.] US Dept Def, Technol Directorate Def Technol Secur Adm DTSA, Washington, DC 20301 USA; [Grenn, Michael W.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Sarkani, Shahram; Mazzuchi, Thomas] George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Grenn, MW (reprint author), US Dept Def, Technol Directorate Def Technol Secur Adm DTSA, Washington, DC 20301 USA.",grennm@gwu.edu; sarkani@gwu.edu; mazzuchi@gwu.edu,,,,,"Stark GE, 1999, J SOFTW MAINT-RES PR, V11, P293, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-908X(199909/10)11:5<293::AID-SMR198>3.0.CO;2-R; Ferreira S, 2009, J SYST SOFTWARE, V82, P1568, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2009.03.014; [Anonymous], 2008, PREM A EARL PHAS SYS; [Anonymous], 2010, SE LEAD IND GUID; [Anonymous], 2011, GAO11233SP; [Anonymous], 2009, GAO09326SP; SHANNON CE, 1956, IRE T INFORM THEOR, V2, P8, DOI 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056798; Macaulay L, 1996, PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING, P157, DOI 10.1109/ICRE.1996.491440; BAILEY KD, 1987, SYST RES, V4, P83, DOI 10.1002/sres.3850040203; [Anonymous], 2010, IMPR PROC DEV BETT P; [Anonymous], 2010, SYST ENG CAS STUD SY; [Anonymous], 2011, DEF ACQ GUID; Rhodes DH, 2009, SYSTEMS ENG, V12, P21, DOI 10.1002/sys.20105; COSTELLO RJ, 1995, J SYST SOFTWARE, V29, P39, DOI 10.1016/0164-1212(94)00127-9; [Anonymous], 2001, SYSTEMS ENG FUNDAMEN; Rouse WB, 2007, SYST ENG, V10, P260, DOI 10.1002/sys.20076; Bahill A.

A significant fraction of the empirical work I discuss was done by Dobzhansky and his coworkers; Goldschmidt was an astute interpreter, with strong and unusual commitments. I argue that both belong to a mechanistic tradition in genetics, concerned with the effects of chromosomal organization and systems on the inheritance patterns of species. Their different trajectories illustrate how scientists' commitments affect how they interpret new evidence and adjust to it. Dobzhansky was moved to revised views about selection, while Goldschmidt moved his attention to different genetic phenomena. However different, there are significant connections between the two that enrich our understanding of their views. I focus on two: the role of developmental considerations in Dobzhansky's thought and the role of neutrality and drift in Goldschmidt's evolutionary account. Dobzhansky's struggle with chromosomal variation is not solely about competing schools of thought within the selectionist camp, as insightfully articulated by John Beatty, but also a story of competition between selectionist thinking and developmental perspectives. In contraposition, Goldschmidt emphasized the role of low penetrance mutations that spread neutrally and pointed out that drift could result from developmental canalization. This account adds to the dominant story about Goldschmidt's resistance to the splitting of development from genetics, as told by Garland Allen and Michael Dietrich. The story I tell illustrates how developmental thinking and genetic thinking conflicted and influenced researchers with different convictions about the significance of chromosomal organization.","Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Lamm, E (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",ehudlamm@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,"Muller HJ, 1932, AM NAT, V66, P118, DOI 10.1086/280418; Sturtevant AH, 1917, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V3, P555, DOI 10.1073/pnas.3.9.555; Dobzhansky T, 1932, GENETICS, V17, P0369; Dobzhansky T, 1935, GENETICS, V20, P0366; Goldschmidt R, 1933, SCIENCE, V78, P539, DOI 10.1126/science.78.2033.539; DUBININ NP, 1945, AM NAT, V79, P570, DOI 10.1086/281297; DOBZHANSKY T, 1950, GENETICS, V35, P288; FELSENSTEIN J, 1974, GENETICS, V78, P737; Dobzhansky T, 1943, GENETICS, V28, P162; BEATTY J, 1987, J HIST BIOL, V20, P289, DOI 10.1007/BF00139457; Wright S, 1941, SCI MON, V53, P165; Hall BK, 2005, J EXP ZOOL PART B, V304B, P187, DOI 10.1002/jez.b.21052; Waddington CH, 1941, NATURE, V147, P108, DOI 10.1038/147108a0; Painter TS, 1934, J HERED, V25, P465; DOBZHANSKY T, 1955, GENETICS, V40, P797; GOLDSCHMIDT RB, 1954, SCIENCE, V119, P703, DOI 10.1126/science.119.3099.703; Mather K, 1943, BIOL REV CAMB PHILOS, V18, P32, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-185X.1943.tb00287.x; Goldschmidt R, 1937, NATURE, V140, P767, DOI 10.1038/140767a0; CROW JF, 1987, J HIST BIOL, V20, P351, DOI 10.1007/BF00139460; BRNCIC D, 1954, GENETICS, V39, P77; Lamm E, 2014, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V592, P2283, DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2014.271734; DUBININ NP, 1946, GENETICS, V31, P537; IVES PT, 1947, EVOLUTION, V1, P42, DOI 10.2307/2405402; MATHER K, 1955, EVOLUTION, V9, P52, DOI 10.2307/2405357; Dietrich MR, 2000, AM ZOOL, V40, P738, DOI 10.1668/0003-1569(2000)040[0738:FHMTHE]2.0.CO;2; Goldschmidt R, 1937, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V23, P621, DOI 10.1073/pnas.23.12.621; Dobzhansky T, 1938, GENETICS, V23, P28; Roll-Hansen N, 2009, J HIST BIOL, V42, P457, DOI 10.1007/s10739-008-9166-8; Gibson AH, 2013, J HIST BIOL, V46, P599, DOI 10.1007/s10739-012-9347-3; Sturtevant AH, 1938, AM NAT, V72, P447, DOI 10.1086/280797; Roll-Hansen N, 2014, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V592, P2431, DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2014.272120; Beatty John, 1987, PROBABILISTIC REVOLU, P271; Beatty John, 1994, P195; Carlson Elof Axel, 1966, GENE CRITICAL HIST; Carson Hampton L., 1980, EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHES; CHETVERI.S, 1961, P AM PHILOS SOC, V105, P167; Darlington Cyril Dean, 1950, ELEMENTS GENETICS; Davis Gregory, 2009, DESCENDED DARWIN INS; Dietrich Michael R., 2000, CONCEPT GENE DEV EVO, P91, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511527296.007; Dietrich Michael R., 2008, REBELS MAVERICKS HER; Dietrich MR, 2011, J HIST BIOL, V44, P693, DOI 10.1007/s10739-011-9271-y; Dobzhansky T., 1937, GENETICS ORIGIN SPEC; DOBZHANSKY T, 1955, COLD SPRING HARB SYM, V20, P1; Dobzhansky T, 1962, MANKIND EVOLVING; Dobzhansky T., 1951, GENETICS ORIGIN SPEC; Dobzhansky T., 1952, Heterosis., P218; Dobzhansky Th, 1953, INT UN BIOL SCI S GE, P95; Dobzhansky Theodosius, 1946, GENETICS, V31, P12; DUBININ NP, 1946, J HERED, V37, P39; Fisher R.

The discussion is based on a case study of barriers to implementing research-based principles of sustainable organic arable farming. The current literature tends to see this problem either as a dissemination issue (the linear approach) or as a failure of science to address real-world problems (the co-constructive approach). We argue that Luhmann's theory of social systems offers a way to understand the shortcomings of existing approaches and enables us to identify knowledge gaps that have often been overlooked so far. This theoretical claim is substantiated by an empirical analysis based on 10 in-depth interviews with owners of organic arable farms. The farmers were interviewed about barriers to the implementation of research-based knowledge in practice. The analysis points to the operational closure and the observational blindness of both research systems and farming systems as the keys to understanding knowledge gaps and suggests new ways of dealing with the problems of implementing research knowledge in practice.,"[Noe, Egon; Alroe, Hugo F.; Thorsoe, Martin H.; Olesen, Jorgen Eivind; Sorensen, Peter; Melander, Bo] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Fog, Erik] Knowledge Ctr Agr, Aarhus, Denmark","Noe, E (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, 50 Blichers Alle 20, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",egon.noe@agrsci.dk,"Melander, Bo/F-1352-2016; Sorensen, Peter/A-4738-2013","Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-3425-3690",,,"Alroe H., 2000, CYBERNETICS HUMAN KN, V7, P57; Alroe H.

They occupy a priority place in middle-and lower-income countries, since the absence or fragility of health systems adversely impacts expected health outcomes. Thus, due to the direct relationship between programs and systems, the absence or weakness of either will result in a consequent deficiency in public health and the very execution of the programs. In the same vein, weakened health systems are one of the main bottlenecks to attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Systems thinking is one of the ""four revolutions in progress"" that are helping to transform health and health care systems. Within that framework, this article identifies conceptual and operational elements of systems applicable to health systems that contribute to overcoming the obstacles and inertia that hinder health activities and outcomes. It discusses relevant concepts characteristic of systems thinking, such as structural variables and dynamic complexity, the relationship between programs and health systems, and the monitoring and evaluation function, together with the role of innovation and systems integration as high-priority elements. This will aid in the development of designs that also stress the context of the components that guide management, identifying processes and outcomes in a health management continuum.","[Erazo, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Med Familiar, Santiago, Chile","Erazo, A (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Med Familiar, Santiago, Chile.",aerazo@med.puc.cl,,,,,"Atun RA, 2004, EUR J PUBLIC HEALTH, V14, P267, DOI 10.1093/eurpub/14.3.267; Okot-Chono R, 2009, INT J TUBERC LUNG D, V13, P955; Coker RJ, 2004, LANCET, V363, P1389, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16053-4; Ashish K., JAMA FOR INN CAR MED; Atun R, 2008, EUROPEAN OBSERVATORY, P121; Atun R, 2005, 0501 ROYAL I INT AFF; Blaauw D, 2003, DIS CONTR PRIOR PROJ; Burns L, 2002, HEALTH AFFAIR, P134; Checkland P.

Greenhouse gas emissions persisting along current trajectories threaten to significantly alter human society. At 0.85 degrees C of anthropogenic warming, deleterious human impacts are acutely evident. Additional warming of 0.5 degrees C-1.0 degrees C from already emitted CO2 will further intensify extreme heat and damaging storm events. Failing to sufficiently address this trend will have a heavy human toll directly and indirectly on health. Along with mitigation efforts, societal adaptation to a warmer world is imperative. Adaptation efforts need to be significantly upscaled to prepare society to lessen the public health effects of rising temperatures. Modifying societal behaviour is inherently complex and presents a major policy challenge. We propose a social systems framework for conceptualizing adaptation that maps out three domains within the adaptation policy landscape: acclimatisation, behavioural adaptation and technological adaptation, which operate at societal and personal levels. We propose that overlaying this framework on a systems approach to societal change planning methods will enhance governments' capacity and efficacy in strategic planning for adaptation. This conceptual framework provides a policy oriented planning assessment tool that will help planners match interventions to the behaviours being targeted for change. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the framework's application as a planning tool.","[Tait, Peter W.; Hanna, Elizabeth G.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Health, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia","Tait, PW (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Health, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Mills St, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia.",aspetert@bigpond.com; Liz.Hanna@anu.edu.au,,,Australian National Health and Medical Research Council; National Climate Change Adaption Research Network via the Climate Change Adaptation for Human Health Initiative (NHMRC) [585408],This study was funded the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Climate Change Adaption Research Network for project funding via the Climate Change Adaptation for Human Health Initiative (NHMRC Grant 585408).,"Binns C, 2011, ASIA-PAC J PUBLIC HE, V23, p5S, DOI 10.1177/1010539510391776; Lee WV, 2014, NAT HAZARDS, V70, P1453, DOI 10.1007/s11069-013-0884-7; [Anonymous], 2014, 20121332180 AUSTR BU; Cooney R, 2007, EUR J INT LAW, V18, P523, DOI 10.1093/ejil/chm030; Peterson GD, 2003, CONSERV BIOL, V17, P358, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01491.x; Chalabi Z, 2014, MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL, V19, P309, DOI 10.1007/s11027-014-9544-9; Sherwood SC, 2010, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V107, P9552, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0913352107; Scrieciu SS, 2014, MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL, V19, P261, DOI 10.1007/s11027-013-9538-z; Friel S, 2009, LANCET, V374, P2016, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0; Dovers SR, 2010, WIRES CLIM CHANGE, V1, P212, DOI 10.1002/wcc.29; Valente TW, 2007, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V34, P881, DOI 10.1177/1090198106297855; McMichael AJ, 2011, J INTERN MED, V270, P401, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02415.x; Barnett J, 2010, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V20, P211, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.11.004; Fussel HM, 2008, INT J ENVIRON HEAL R, V18, P37, DOI 10.1080/09603120701358416; Moloney S, 2010, ENERG POLICY, V38, P7614, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.06.058; Burton I, 2002, CLIM POLICY, V2, P145, DOI 10.1016/S1469-3062(02)00038-4; EHRLICH PR, 1971, SCIENCE, V171, P1212, DOI 10.1126/science.171.3977.1212; New M, 2011, PHILOS T R SOC A, V369, P6, DOI 10.1098/rsta.2010.0303; O'Brien K, 2013, PROG HUM GEOG, V37, P587, DOI 10.1177/0309132512469589; Bobb JF, 2014, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V122, P811, DOI 10.1289/ehp.1307392; Proust K, 2012, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V9, P2134, DOI 10.3390/ijerph9062134; Schultz PW, 2007, PSYCHOL SCI, V18, P429, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x; Swart R, 2007, CLIM POLICY, V7, P288; Hanna EG, 2015, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V12, P8034, DOI 10.3390/ijerph120708034; Glass K, 2015, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V12, P5241, DOI 10.3390/ijerph120505241; [Anonymous], 2008, CREATURES HABIT ART; Barreca A., 2013, 18692 NAT BUR EC RES; Bell ML, 2003, SOCIOECONOMIC PLANNI, V37, P289, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0038-0121(02)00047-2; Bi P, 2011, ASIA-PAC J PUBLIC HE, V23, p27S, DOI 10.1177/1010539510391644; Burton I., 2006, ADAPTATION CLIMATE C; Cena K., 1981, BIOENGINEERING THERM; Cialdini R.

The methodology draws on system dynamics and Back Propagation (BP) neural network. According to 7 setting principles, this study identifies 13 tourism sustainability indicators including conventional tourism income, tourism resources stock, pollution stock, etc., as well as specific residents' tourism cognition, seasonal difference, accessibility, etc. Then a system dynamics model including the 13 indicators (variables) and other relevant auxiliary variables is established. Based on the numerical simulation, using a three layers BP neural network optimized by genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, this study evaluates the future sustainability dynamically and compares the sustainability evolution from 2014 to 2050 under different development strategies. The research results not only provide information useful for the dynamic control and scientific management of the future sustainable tourism development, but also provide a systems approach to evaluate regional tourism sustainability.

The ever-widening gap between discovery of scientific best practices and their mass adoption by families (the evidence-practice gap) is not just a matter of improving the coverage of health worker-community interactions. The design of the interactions themselves must be guided by sound behavioral science approaches such that they lead to mass adoption and impact at a large scale. The main barrier to the application of scientific approaches to behavior change is our inability to ""unbox"" the ""black box"" of family health behaviors in community settings. The authors argue that these are not black boxes, but in fact thoughtfully designed community systems that have been designed and upheld, and have evolved over many years keeping in mind a certain worldview and a common social purpose. An empathetic understanding of these community systems allows us to deconstruct the causal pathways of existing behaviors, and re-engineer them to achieve desired outcomes. One of the key reasons for the failure of interactions to translate into behavior change is our failure to recognize that the content, context, and process of interactions need to be designed keeping in mind an organized community system with a very different worldview and beliefs. In order to improve the adoption of scientific best practices by communities, we need to adapt them to their culture by leveraging existing beliefs, practices, people, context, and skills. The authors present a systems approach for community-centric design of interactions, highlighting key principles for achieving intrinsically motivated, sustained change in social norms and family health behaviors, elucidated with progressive theories from systems thinking, management sciences, cross-cultural psychology, learning and social cognition, and the behavioral sciences.

Greater vaccine thermostability is generally touted as the obvious solution. Despite conventional wisdom, comprehensive analysis of the value proposition for increasing vaccine thermostability has been lacking. Further, while significant investments have been made in increasing vaccine thermostability in recent years, no vaccine products have been commercialized as a result. We analyzed the value proposition for increasing vaccine thermostability, grounding the analysis in specific vaccine use cases (e.g., use in routine immunization [RI] programs, or in campaigns) and in the broader context of cold chain technology and country level supply chain system design. The results were often surprising. For example, cold chain costs actually represent a relatively small fraction of total vaccine delivery system costs. Further, there are critical, vaccine use case-specific temporal thresholds that need to be overcome for significant benefits to be reaped from increasing vaccine thermostability. We present a number of recommendations deriving from this analysis that suggest a rational path toward unlocking the value (maximizing coverage, minimizing total system costs) of increased vaccine thermostability, including: (1) the full range of thermostability of existing vaccines should be defined and included in their labels; (2) for new vaccines, thermostability goals should be addressed up-front at the level of the target product profile; (3) improving cold chain infrastructure and supply chain system design is likely to have the largest impact on total system costs and coverage in the short term and will influence the degree of thermostability required in the future; (4) in the long term, there remains value in monitoring the emergence of disruptive technologies that could remove the entire RI portfolio out of the cold chain.

We report on an approach to developing a system oriented community perspective on the causes of obesity. Methods Group model building sessions were conducted in a rural Australian community to address increasing childhood obesity. Stakeholders (n = 12) built a community model that progressed from connection circles to causal loop diagrams using scripts from the system dynamics literature. Participants began this work in identifying change over time in causes and effects of childhood obesity within their community. The initial causal loop diagram was then reviewed and elaborated by 50 community leaders over a full day session. Results The process created a causal loop diagram representing community perceptions of determinants and causes of obesity. The causal loop diagram can be broken down into four separate domains; social influences; fast food and junk food; participation in sport; and general physical activity. Discussion This causal loop diagram can provide the basis for community led planning of a prevention response that engages with multiple levels of existing settings and systems.","[Allender, Steven; Owen, Brynle; Whelan, Jill] Deakin Univ, WHO, Collaborating Ctr Obes Prevent, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia; [Kuhlberg, Jill] Washington Univ, George Warren Brown Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO USA; [Lowe, Janette] Southern Grampians Glenelg Primary Care Partnersh, Hamilton, Vic, Australia; [Nagorcka-Smith, Phoebe] Portland Dist Hlth, Portland, Vic, Australia; [Bell, Colin] Deakin Univ, Sch Med, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia","Allender, S (reprint author), Deakin Univ, WHO, Collaborating Ctr Obes Prevent, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia.",steven.allender@deakin.edu.au,,,Australian National Health and Medical Research Council/Australian National Heart Foundation [APP1045836]; US National Institutes of Health [1R01HL115485-01A1]; NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Obesity Policy and Food Systems [APP1041020]; Southern Grampians Glenelg Primary Care,"SA is supported by funding from an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council/Australian National Heart Foundation Career Development Fellowship (APP1045836).

Systems thinking is widely considered as an effective approach to understanding and managing the complexity. This paper aims to better understand dynamic complexity of construction safety management by exploring archetypes of construction safety. To achieve this, this paper adopted the ground theory method (GTM) and 22 interviews were conducted with participants in various positions (government safety inspector, client, health and safety manager, safety consultant, safety auditor, and safety researcher). Eight archetypes were emerged from the collected data: (1) safety regulations, (2) incentive programs, (3) procurement and safety, (4) safety management in small businesses (5) production and safety, (6) workers' conflicting goals, (7) blame on workers, and (8) reactive and proactive learning. These archetypes capture the interactions between a wide range of factors within various hierarchical levels and subsystems. As a free-standing tool, they advance the understanding of dynamic complexity of construction safety management and provide systemic insights into dealing with the complexity. They also can facilitate system dynamics modelling of construction safety process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Guo, Brian H.

Scholars from a variety of disciplines have also long conceptualized cities as systems, but few have modeled urban health issues as problems within a system. Systems thinking in general and system dynamics in particular are relatively new approaches in public health, but ones that hold immense promise as methodologies to model and analyze the complexity underlying urban processes to effectively inform policy actions in dynamic environments. This conceptual essay reviews the utility of applying the concepts, principles, and methods of systems thinking to the study of complex urban health phenomena as a complementary approach to standard epidemiological methods using specific examples and provides recommendations on how to better incorporate systems thinking methods in urban health research and practice.","[Tozan, Yesim; Ompad, Danielle C.] NYU, Global Inst Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Tozan, Yesim] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY USA; [Tozan, Yesim] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ompad, Danielle C.] NYU, Ctr Drug Use & HIV Res, New York, NY USA; [Ompad, Danielle C.] NYU, Ctr Hlth Ident Behav & Prevent Studies, New York, NY USA","Ompad, DC (reprint author), NYU, Global Inst Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10012 USA.",dco2@nyu.edu,,,New York University Abu Dhabi's Visiting Scholars Program; Center for Drug Use and HIV Research [CDUHR - P30 DA011041],This research has been supported by New York University Abu Dhabi's Visiting Scholars Program.

KTA approaches that apply principles of systems thinking are thought to hold promise, but practical strategies for their application are not well understood. In this paper we report the results of a scan of systems approaches to KTA with a goal to identify how to optimize their implementation and impact. Methods: A 5-person advisory group purposefully selected 9 initiatives to achieve diversity on issues addressed and organizational forms. Information on each case was gathered from documents and through telephone interviews with primary contacts within each organization. Following verification of case descriptions, an inductive analysis was conducted within and across cases. Results: The cases revealed 5 guidelines for moving from conceiving KTA systems to implementing them: 1) establish and nurture relationships, 2) co-produce and curate knowledge, 3) create feedback loops, 4) frame as systems interventions rather than projects, and 5) consider variations across time and place. Conclusion: Results from the environmental scan are a modest start to translating systems concepts for KTA into practice. Use of the strategies revealed in the scan may improve KTA for solving complex public health problems. The strategies themselves will benefit from the development of a science that aims to understand adaptation and ongoing learning from policy and practice interventions, strengthens enduring relationships, and fills system gaps in addition to evidence gaps. Systems approaches to KTA will also benefit from robust evaluations.","[Riley, B. L.] Univ Waterloo, Propel Ctr Populat Hlth Impact, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Robinson, K.

We describe how an innovative systems analysis approach halted repeated scabies outbreaks, and highlight the importance of systems thinking for outbreaks analysis and sustaining effective infection prevention and control. Methods: Following RCA for a third successive outbreak of scabies over a 17-month period in a 60-bed respiratory care ward of a Taiwan hospital, a systems-oriented event analysis (SOEA) model was used to reanalyze the outbreak. Both approaches and the recommendations were compared. Results: No nosocomial scabies have been reported for more than 1975 days since implementation of the SOEA. Previous intervals between seeming eradication and repeat outbreaks following RCA were 270 days and 180 days. Achieving a sustainable positive resolution relied on applying systems thinking and the holistic analysis of the system, not merely looking for root causes of events. Conclusion: To improve the effectiveness of outbreaks analysis and infection control, an emphasis on systems thinking is critical, along with a practical approach to ensure its effective implementation. The SOEA model provides the necessary framework and is a viable complementary approach, or alternative, to RCA.

Systems engineering, on the other hand, has enabled us to develop principles and methodologies for designing and operating engineered networks of structures exploring the integration of the underlying governing (design) laws. Although the computational tools which have resulted in major advances in the design, analysis, and operation of complex engineered structures have had tremendous success in the analysis of systems pharmacology models, it is argued in this opinion paper, that exploring the underlying conceptual foundation of complex systems engineering will enable us to move toward integrated models at the host level to explore, and possibly, induce synergies between low-level drug targets and higher level, systemic, defense mechanisms. This is an approach which would require refocusing of the key activities; however, it is likely the more promising approach as we enter the new era of personalized and precision medicine. We finally argue for the development of an allostatic approach to quantitative systems pharmacology and the development of an integrated framework for considering drugs in their broader context, beyond their local site of action.

Within this perspective, work system design emphasises factors such as the joint optimisation of social and technical processes, a focus on reliable human-system performance and safety metrics as design and analysis criteria, the maintenance of a realistic and consistent set of safety objectives and policies, and regular access to the expertise and input of workers. We discuss three current approaches to the analysis and design of complex sociotechnical systems: human-systems integration, macroergonomics and safety climate. Each approach emphasises key sociotechnical systems themes, and each prescribes a more holistic perspective on work systems than do traditional theories and methods. We contrast these perspectives with historical precedents such as system safety and traditional human factors and ergonomics, and describe potential future directions for their application in research and practice. Practitioner Summary: The identification of factors that can reliably distinguish between safe and unsafe work systems is an important concern for ergonomists and other safety professionals. This paper presents a variety of sociotechnical systems perspectives on intersections between social-organisational and technology-work process factors as they impact work system analysis, design and operation.","[Kleiner, Brian M.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Hettinger, Lawrence J.; Huang, Yuang-Hsiang] Liberty Mutual Res Inst Safety, Ctr Behav Sci, Hopkinton, MA 01748 USA; [DeJoy, David M.] Univ Georgia, Dept Hlth Promot & Behav, Ramsey Ctr 315, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Love, Peter E.

First, archetypal examples from the field of bio-inspired robot locomotion are presented to prepare the ground for further discussion. The general problem of locomotion is then stated. In considering this problem, we progressively draw a unified geometric picture of locomotion dynamics. For that purpose, we start from the model of discrete mobile multibody systems (MMSs) that we progressively extend to the case of continuous and finally soft systems. Beyond these theoretical aspects, we address the practical problem of the efficient computation of these models by proposing a Newton-Euler-based approach to efficient locomotion dynamics with a few illustrations of creeping, swimming, and flying.","[Boyer, Frederic; Porez, Mathieu] Ecole Mines Nantes, IRCCyN, F-44307 Nantes 3, France","Boyer, F (reprint author), Ecole Mines Nantes, IRCCyN, La Chantrerie 4,Rue Alfred Kastler,BP 20722, F-44307 Nantes 3, France.",frederic.boyer@mines-nantes.fr; mathieu.porez@mines-nantes.fr,,,,,"Abraham R, 1994, FOUNDATIONS OF MECHA; GRAY J, 1950, J EXP BIOL, V26, P354; Dickinson MH, 2000, SCIENCE, V288, P100, DOI 10.1126/science.288.5463.100; Hatton RL, 2011, IEEE INT C INT ROBOT, P3893, DOI 10.1109/IROS.2011.6048659; Beal DN, 2006, J FLUID MECH, V549, P385, DOI 10.1017/S0022112005007925; TRIANTAFYLLOU MS, 1995, SCI AM, V272, P64; Triantafyllou MS, 2000, ANNU REV FLUID MECH, V32, P33, DOI 10.1146/annurev.fluid.32.1.33; CANAVIN JR, 1977, J SPACECRAFT ROCKETS, V14, P724, DOI 10.2514/3.57256; Kanso E, 2005, J NONLINEAR SCI, V15, P255, DOI 10.1007/s00332-004-0650-9; Richter C, 2011, ARTIF LIFE, V17, P73, DOI 10.1162/artl_a_00020; Boyer F, 2010, J NONLINEAR SCI, V20, P47, DOI 10.1007/s00332-009-9050-5; Liljeback P, 2011, IEEE T ROBOT, V27, P792, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2011.2134150; Dickinson MH, 1999, SCIENCE, V284, P1954, DOI 10.1126/science.284.5422.1954; Muller UK, 1997, J EXP BIOL, V200, P2893; Ostrowski J, 1998, INT J ROBOT RES, V17, P683, DOI 10.1177/027836499801700701; REISSNER E, 1973, STUD APPL MATH, V52, P87; Cianchetti M, 2011, MAT SCI ENG C-MATER, V31, P1230, DOI 10.1016/j.msec.2010.12.004; Chevallereau C, 2001, ROBOTICA, V19, P557; Boyer F, 2014, IEEE T ROBOT, V30, P578, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2013.2294733; Boyer F, 2012, IEEE T ROBOT, V28, P303, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2011.2171616; Boyer F, 1996, J ROBOTIC SYST, V13, P11, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4563(199601)13:1<11::AID-ROB2>3.0.CO;2-Y; SHAPERE A, 1989, J FLUID MECH, V198, P557, DOI 10.1017/S002211208900025X; Ostrowski JP, 1999, IEEE T ROBOTIC AUTOM, V15, P111, DOI 10.1109/70.744607; Hatton RL, 2009, 2009 IEEE-RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS, P840, DOI 10.1109/IROS.2009.5354257; Liu H, 2009, J COMPUT PHYS, V228, P439, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2008.09.020; Kanso E, 2009, J FLUID MECH, V631, P127, DOI 10.1017/S0022112009006806; Boyer F, 2005, PMM-J APPL MATH MEC+, V69, P925, DOI 10.1016/j.jappmathmech.2005.11.015; Muller UK, 2001, J EXP BIOL, V204, P2751; PURCELL EM, 1977, AM J PHYS, V45, P3, DOI 10.1119/1.10903; Boyer F, 2006, IEEE T ROBOT, V22, P763, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2006.875492; Candelier F, 2011, J FLUID MECH, V674, P196, DOI 10.1017/S002211201000649X; Hatton RL, 2011, INT J ROBOT RES, V30, P988, DOI 10.1177/0278364910394392; Arnold V I, 1988, MATHEMATICAL METHODS; Arnold V.

The early problem definition phase requires an application of systems thinking with adequate modeling tools and methods. Then, the later problem definition phase and early system architecting phase requires transferring the captured problem to systems engineering tools and methods through emerging techniques such as model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using SysML (MBSE is the practice of using a modeling tools to capture systems engineering diagrams). This paper presents a method for capturing a problem through systemigrams and the Boardman soft systems methodology and then directly translating the systemigrams into SysML diagrams. With MBSE increasing in usage, this method could provide a time savings opportunity during model development along with the possibility of lowering information distortion or loss that can occur during transformation of systems thinking to systems engineering activities. This paper includes a case study which demonstrates how the proposed approach was applied on a problem being considered by the U.S. Army-Contingency Basing for Small Combat Units. Finally, this paper will provide the conclusion on the development of the method and describe future research directions that can allow systems thinking and MBSE to function in a congruent methodology.","[Cloutier, Robert; Bone, Mary] Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Sauser, Brian] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Taylor, Andrew] US Army Natick Soldier Res, Ctr Dev & Engn, Natick, MA 01760 USA","Sauser, B (reprint author), Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",brian.sauser@unt.edu,,,Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC); University Affiliated Research Center,This work was supported by the Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC).

Currently, battery cycle- and calendar-life represents one of the greatest uncertainties in the total life-cycle cost of battery systems. The field of battery aging modeling and prognosis has seen progress with respect to model-based and data-driven approaches to describe the aging of battery cells. However, in real world applications cells are interconnected and aging propagates. The propagation of aging from one cell to others exhibits itself in a reduced battery system life. This paper proposes a control-oriented battery pack model that describes the propagation of aging and its effect on the life span of battery systems. The modeling approach is such that it is able to predict pack aging, thermal, and electrical dynamics under actual PHEV operation, and includes consideration of random variability of the cells, electrical topology and thermal management. The modeling approach is based on the interaction between dynamic system models of the electrical and thermal dynamics, and dynamic models of cell aging. The system-level state-of-health (SOH) is assessed based on knowledge of individual cells SOH, pack electrical topology and voltage equalization approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual end-points with emphasis on ENM risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine ENM benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of ENM SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the SEE system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable ENMs in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature. Rather, it is a position paper that largely expresses the views of the authors based on their expert opinion drawn from industrial and academic experience.

With the aging of populations, new un-faced challenges are brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be well-functioning until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive. However, as the lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration emerge. There are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment; therefore, the complex aging phenomena needs further understanding. It is known that immunosenescence is highly correlated to the negative effects of aging. In this work we advocate the use of simulation as a tool to assist the understanding of immune aging phenomena. In particular, we are comparing system dynamics modelling and simulation (SDMS) and agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) for the case of age-related depletion of naive T cells in the organism. We address the following research questions: Which simulation approach is more suitable for this problem? Can these approaches be employed interchangeably? Is there any benefit of using one approach compared to the other? Results show that both simulation outcomes closely fit the observed data and existing mathematical model; and the likely contribution of each of the naive T cell repertoire maintenance method can therefore be estimated. The differences observed in the outcomes of both approaches are due to the probabilistic character of ABMS contrasted to SDMS. However, they do not interfere in the overall expected dynamics of the populations. In this case, therefore, they can be employed interchangeably, with SDMS being simpler to implement and taking less computational resources.","[Figueredo, Grazziela P.; Siebers, Peer-Olaf; Aickelin, Uwe; Garibaldi, Jonathan M.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Figueredo, Grazziela P.; Garibaldi, Jonathan M.] Univ Nottingham, Adv Data Anal Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Whitbrook, Amanda] Univ Loughborough, Dept Comp Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England","Figueredo, GP (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",grazziela.figueredo@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,"Lorenzi AR, 2008, J IMMUNOL METHODS, V339, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.jim.2008.09.013; FORRESTER JW, 1958, HARVARD BUS REV, V36, P37; ComansBitter WM, 1997, J PEDIATR-US, V130, P388, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3476(97)70200-2; Macal CM, 2010, J SIMUL, V4, P151, DOI 10.1057/jos.2010.3; Franceschi C, 2000, VACCINE, V18, P1717, DOI 10.1016/S0264-410X(99)00513-7; Cossarizza A, 1996, MECH AGEING DEV, V86, P173, DOI 10.1016/0047-6374(95)01691-0; Lorenz T, 2009, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V5466, P141, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-01109-2_11; Murray JM, 2003, IMMUNOL CELL BIOL, V81, P487, DOI 10.1046/j.1440-1711.2003.01191.x; Barton Pelham, 2004, J Health Serv Res Policy, V9, P110, DOI 10.1258/135581904322987535; BORSHCHEV A., 2004, P 22 INT C SYST DYN; Bulatti M, 2008, IMMUNITY AGEING, P5; Figueredo GP, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, P4; Figueredo GP, 2010, P SUMM COMP SIM C; Figueredo GP, 2012, THESIS U NOTTINGHAM; Kirkwood C.W., 1998, SYSTEM DYNAMICS METH; Macal CM, 2010, P WINT SIM C; Pidd M., 2003, TOOLS THINKING MODEL; Pourdehnad J., 2002, P 20 INT C SYST DYN; Ramandad H, 2008, MANAGE SCI, P5; Richardson G., 1981, INTRO SYSTEM DYNAMIC; Robinson S., 2004, SIMULATION PRACTICE; Schieritz N, 2002, P 20 INT C SYST DYN; Schieritz N, 2004, P SYST DYN C; Schieritz N., 2003, P 21 INT C SYST DYN; Scholl H.J.J., 2001, P 34 ANN HAW INT C S; Siebers P.

Using fueling and power demand data from an existing public hydrogen station in Irvine, California, dynamic analyses of the self-sustainable station have been carried out. Various control strategies are developed and evaluated to determine the impacts of control strategies and renewable capacity factors on the efficiency and other performance characteristics of the station. The simulation results and analysis suggest that with careful sizing and system design, a self-sustainable hydrogen fueling station that relies completely upon renewable sources for hydrogen production, storage and dispensing is feasible. Moreover, a cost and sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the levelized hydrogen cost for different station designs. The cost of the hydrogen is determined to be as low as $6.71 per kg or $9.14 per kg when the station is powered by 200 kW of wind turbines or 360 kW of PV arrays, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine HCW work system barriers to and facilitators of adherence to contact isolation for patients with suspected or confirmed Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using a human factors and systems engineering approach. Methods: This prospective cohort study took place between September 2013 and November 2013 at a large academic medical center (hospital A) and an affiliated Veterans Administration hospital (hospital B). A human factors engineering (HFE) model for patient safety, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, was used to guide work system analysis and direct observation data collection. There were 288 observations conducted. HCWs and visitors were assessed for compliance with all components of contact isolation precautions (hand hygiene, gowning, and gloving) before and after patient contact. Time required to complete contact isolation precautions was measured, and adequacy of contact isolation supplies was assessed. Results: Full compliance with contact isolation precautions was low at both hospitals A (7%) and B (22%). Lack of appropriate hand hygiene prior to room entry (compliance for hospital A: 18%; compliance for hospital B: 29%) was the most common reason for lack of full compliance. More time was required for full compliance compared with compliance with no components of contact isolation precautions before patient room entry, inside patient room, and after patient room exit (59.9 vs 3.2 seconds, P <. 001; 507.3 vs 149.7 seconds, P = .006; 15.2 vs 1.3 seconds, P <.001, respectively). Compliance was lower when contact isolation supplies were inadequate (4% vs 16%, P = .005). Conclusions: Adherence to contact isolation precautions for CDI is a complex, time-consuming process. HFE analysis indicates that multiple work system components serve as barriers and facilitators to full compliance with contact isolation precautions and should be addressed further to prevent CDI.

The main motivation for writing this paper is to facilitate the development and deployment of control systems technologies so as to ensure quality of the drug product. Although the main focus is on small-molecule pharmaceutical products, most of the same statements apply to biological drug products. An introduction to continuous manufacturing and control systems is followed by a discussion of the current status and technical needs in process monitoring and control, systems integration, and risk analysis. Some key points are that: (1) the desired objective in continuous manufacturing should be the satisfaction of all critical quality attributes (CQAs), not for all variables to operate at steady-state values; (2) the design of start-up and shutdown procedures can significantly affect the economic operation of a continuous manufacturing process; (3) the traceability of material as it moves through the manufacturing facility is an important consideration that can at least in part be addressed using residence time distributions; and (4) the control systems technologies must assure quality in the presence of disturbances, dynamics, uncertainties, nonlinearities, and constraints. Direct measurement, first-principles and empirical model-based predictions, and design space approaches are described for ensuring that CQA specifications are met. Ways are discussed for universities, regulatory bodies, and industry to facilitate working around or through barriers to the development of control systems engineering technologies for continuous drug manufacturing. Industry and regulatory bodies should work with federal agencies to create federal funding mechanisms to attract faculty to this area. Universities should hire faculty interested in developing first-principles models and control systems technologies for drug manufacturing that are easily transportable to industry. Industry can facilitate the move to continuous manufacturing by working with universities on the conception of new continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit operations that have the potential to make major improvements in product quality, controllability, or reduced capital and/or operating costs. Regulatory bodies should ensure that: (1) regulations and regulatory practices promote, and do not derail, the development and implementation of continuous manufacturing and control systems engineering approaches; (2) the individuals who approve specific regulatory filings are sufficiently trained to make good decisions regarding control systems approaches; (3) provide regulatory clarity and eliminate/reduce regulatory risks; (4) financially support the development of high-quality training materials for use of undergraduate students, graduate students, industrial employees, and regulatory staff; (5) enhance the training of their own technical staff by financially supporting joint research projects with universities in the development of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and the associated control systems engineering theory, numerical algorithms, and software; and (6) strongly encourage the federal agencies that support research to fund these research areas.

By using renewable raw materials, biotechnology contributes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petro-based towards a circular sustainable economy. However, major developments are still needed to make industrial biotechnology an economic alternative to conventional processes for fuels, specialty and/or bulk chemicals production. Process integration is a holistic approach to process design, which emphasizes the unity of the process and considers the interactions between different unit operations from the outset, rather than optimizing them separately. Furthermore, it also involves the substitution of two or more unit operations by one single novel unit capable of achieving the same process goal. Conversely, process systems engineering (PSE) deals with the analysis, design, optimization, operation and control of complex process systems, as well as the development of model-based methods and tools that allow the systematic development of processes and products across a wide range of systems involving physical and chemical change. Mature tools and applications are available for chemical technology and steps have been taken to apply PSE principles also to bioprocess technology. This perspective paper argues that an interdisciplinary approach is needed towards integrated bio-processing in order to link basic developments in biosciences with possible industrial applications. PSE can foster the application of existing and the development of new methods and tools for bioprocess integration that could promote the sustainable production of bio-/chemical products. The inclusion of PSE principles and methods in biochemical engineering curricula and research is essential to achieve such goals.

Here we focus on two BCEs: decreasing the total mass of toxic metals that could leach into a beach from marine plastics and preventing the fragmentation of marine plastics on the beach. Both BCEs depend strongly on the average residence time of marine plastics on the beach (tau(r)) and the period of temporal variability of the input flux of marine plastics (1). Cleanups on the beach where tau(r) is longer than Tare more effective than those where tau(r) is shorter than T. In addition, both BCEs are the highest near the time when the remnants of plastics reach the local maximum (peak time). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the following three factors for effective cleanups: the average residence time, the plastic input period and the peak time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

(sugar beet crops) under future climate change scenarios. RESULTSA system dynamics model was developed which takes account of the effects of rainfall and temperature on sugar beetyields under limited irrigation conditions. A relationship was also developed between the seasonal evapotranspiration and seasonal growing degree days for sugar beet crops. The proposed model was set to run for the present time period of 1993-2012 and for the future period 2013-2040 for Lethbridge region (Alberta, Canada). The model provides sugar beet yields on a yearly basis which are comparable to the present field data. It was found that the future average yield will be increased at about 14% with respect to the present average yield. CONCLUSIONThe proposed model can help to improve the understanding of soil water conditions and irrigation water requirements of an area under certain climatic conditions and can be used for future prediction of yields for any crops in any region (with the required information to be provided). The developed system dynamics model can be used as a supporting tool for decision making, for improvement of agricultural management practice of any region.

In this study, based on the difference method for stochastic partial differential equations, a novel state-space model named multi-input-multi-output extended partially linear model for stochastic spatio-temporal dynamical system is proposed. A new Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space-based algorithm named extended partially linear least square ridge regression is thus particularly developed for the identification of the extended partially linear model. Compared with existing identification methods available for spatio-temporal dynamics, the advantages of the proposed identification method include that (i) it can make full use of the partially linear structural information of physical models, (ii) it can achieve more accurate estimation results for system non-linear dynamics and (iii) the resulting estimated model parameters have clear physical meaning or properties closely related to the underlying dynamical system. Moreover, the proposed extended partially linear model also provide a convenient state-space model for system analysis and design (e.g. controller or filter design) of the class of non-linear stochastic partial differential dynamical systems.","[Ning, Hanwen] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jing, Xingjian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jing, Xingjian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Ning, HW (reprint author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xingjian.jing@polyu.edu.hk,"Jing, Xingjian/B-2120-2008","Jing, Xingjian/0000-0003-3498-2180","National Science Foundation of China [61374041, 11301544, 11226206]","The authors thank the editor and reviewers for their patience and time in reviewing this paper, and also give thanks for the valuable suggestions from Prof. Dirk Hemeiser.

The scope of this case study is to draw experience from where we left off. At the end of the 1990s there was growing interest in stealth for combat vehicles in Sweden. An ambitious technology demonstrator project was launched. One of the outcomes was a proposed Systems Engineering process tailored for signature management presented to SPIE in 2002.(Olsson et. al, A systems approach., Proc. SPIE 4718) The process was used for the Swedish/BAE Systems Hagglunds AB development of a multirole armored platform (The Swedish acronym is SEP). Before development was completed there was a change of procurement policy in Sweden from domestic development towards Governmental Off-The-Shelf, preceded by a Swedish Armed Forces change of focus from national defense only, towards expeditionary missions. Lessons learned, of value for future development, are presented. They are deduced from interviews of key-personnel, on the procurer and industry sides respectively, and from document reviews.","[Andersson, Kent E.; Hult, Gunnar] Swedish Def Univ, Box 278 05, SE-11593 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kariis, Hans] Swedish Def Res Agcy, SE-58111 Linkoping, Sweden","Andersson, KE (reprint author), Swedish Def Univ, Box 278 05, SE-11593 Stockholm, Sweden.",kent.andersson@fhs.se,,,,,"Akerlind Christina, 2015, THESIS LINKOPING U; Andersson Kent E., 2015, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, P1; Andersson Kent E., 2014, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V84, P1; Forssell G, 2002, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V4819, P145, DOI 10.1117/12.450924; [Anonymous], 2004, COLORIMETRY; [Anonymous], 2012, RADTHERMIR PAINT CRE; Forssell G, 2003, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V5075, P246, DOI 10.1117/12.487312; Arney JS, 2006, J PULP PAP SCI, V32, P19; Bohman Lars, 2003, SAT HDB; CIE, 2006, 1752006 CIE; Fagerstrom Jan, 2009, FOIR2888SE; Fagerstrom Jan, 2011, FOIR3268SE; Farrier Lisa M., 2006, THESIS; Forssell Goran, 2002, FOIR0594SE; Forssell Goran, 2005, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, P1; Hasan Mokhtar M., 2012, ARPN J SCI TECHNOLOG, V2, P265; Hecht E., 2002, OPTICS; Jafolla James, 1998, ADA399506; Kim J, 2010, J VISION, V10, DOI 10.1167/10.9.3; Meyers Jason P., 2002, THESIS CF CARLSON CT; Nicodemus F.

Design/methodology/approach - Close-reading of selected texts, historiography, and case studies in current developments in the Monte Carlo method of high-energy particle physics (HEP) for developing a platform for bridging the apparently incommensurable differences between the physical-mathematical and the biological sciences. Findings - First, usefulness of the cybernetic approach for historicizing the Monte Carlo method in relation to digital computing and quantum physics. Second, development of an inter/trans-disciplinary approach to the hard sciences through a critical re-evaluation of the historical texts of von Foerster and von Neumann for application to developments in quantum theory, biophysics, and computing. Research limitations/implications - This work is largely theoretical and uses dialectical thought experiments to engage between sciences operating across different ontological scales. Practical implications - Consideration of developments of quantum computing and how that would change one's perception of information, data, and the way in which analysis is currently performed with big data. Originality/value - This is the first time that von Neumann and von Foerster have been contrasted and compared in relation to their epistemic compatibility, historical importance, and relevance for producing a creative approach to current scientific epistemology. This paper hopes to change how the authors view trans-disciplinary/inter-disciplinary practices in the sciences and produce new vistas of thought in the history and philosophy of science.","[Lee, Clarissa Ai Ling] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi 43600, Malaysia","Lee, CAL (reprint author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",clarissal@gmail.com,,,,,"LANDAUER R, 1988, NATURE, V335, P779, DOI 10.1038/335779a0; Pask G, 1996, SYST RES, V13, P349; Grossing G, 2005, KYBERNETES, V34, P222, DOI 10.1108/03684920510575816; Aspray W., 1990, J VONNEUMANN ORIGINS; Beer S., 1962, PRINCIPLES SELF ORG, P24; ECKHARDT R., 1987, LOS ALAMOS SCI, V15, P131; Gasca A.M., 2000, WORLD MATH GAME J VO; Glimm J., 1990, P SUMMER RES I LEGAC; Husserl E., 1931, IDEAS GEN INTRO PURE; Knorr Cetina K, 1999, EPISTEMIC CULTURES S; Mermin N.D., 2007, QUANTUM COMPUTER SCI; Milatos G.I., 2010, THESIS; Robinson DK, 1992, DATA REDUCTION ERROR; Taub AH, 1961, J VONNEUMANN COLLECT, V5, P288; Ulam S.M., 1949, P 2 S LARG SCAL DIG; Ulam S.M., 1990, ANALOGIES ANALOGIES; Van de Vijver G., 1992, NEW PERSPECTIVES CYB; Von Foerster H., 1979, UNDERSTING UNDERS; VonFoerster H, 2014, MEAN SYST, P1; von Foerster H., 2001, UNDERSTING UNDERS; von Foerster H., 1950, CYB CIRC CAUS FEEDB; von Neumann J., 1949, J VONNEUMANN K VONNE; von Neumann J., 1968, COMPUTER BRAIN",23,0,0,3,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,1758-7883,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2015,44,9-Aug,,,,,1310,1323,,10.1108/K-10-2014-0227,,14,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Computer Science,CY8DH,WOS:000366638300013,S,"Grogan, PT; de Weck, OL; Ross, AM; Rhodes, DH",,"Wade, J; Cloutier, R",,"Grogan, Paul T.; de Weck, Olivier L.; Ross, Adam M.; Rhodes, Donna H.",,,Interactive models as a system design tool: Applications to system project management,2015 CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING RESEARCH,Procedia Computer Science,,English,Proceedings Paper,Conference on Systems Engineering Research,"MAR 17-19, 2015","Hoboken, NJ",,,Systems engineering; system project management; modeling and simulation; system dynamics; web services,COMPLEXITY,"Frequent and significant cost and schedule overruns in large aerospace and defense projects are hypothesized to be attributed to limitations on designers' perception of complex systems.

The definition was derived from a review of the systems thinking literature combined with the application of systems thinking to itself. Many different definitions of systems thinking can be found throughout the systems community, but key components of a singular definition can be distilled from the literature. This researcher considered these components both individually and holistically, then proposed a new definition of systems thinking that integrates these components as a system. The definition was tested for fidelity against a System Test and against three widely accepted system archetypes. Systems thinking is widely believed to be critical in handling the complexity facing the world in the coming decades; however, it still resides in the educational margins. In order for this important skill to receive mainstream educational attention, a complete definition is required. Such a definition has not yet been established. This research is an attempt to rectify this deficiency by providing such a definition.

Returning to work following a job-related injury or illness can be a complex process, influenced by a range of interrelated personal, psychosocial, and organizational components. System dynamics modelling (SDM) takes a sociotechnical systems perspective to view return-to-work (RTW) as a system made up of multiple feedback relationships between influential components. Design and Methods. To build the RTW SDM, a mixed-method approach will be used. The first stage, that has already been completed, involved creating a baseline model using key informant interviews. Second, in two manufacturing companies, stakeholder-based models will be developed through interviews and focus groups with senior management, frontline workers, and frontline supervisors. Participants will be asked about the RTW process in general and more targeted questions regarding influential components. Participants will also be led through a reference mode exercise where they will be asked to estimate the direction, shape and magnitude of relationships between influential components. Data will be entered into the software program Vensim that provides a platform for visualizing system-structure and simulating the effects of adapting components. Finally, preliminary model validity testing will be conducted to provide insights on model generalizability and sensitivity. Expected Impact of the study for Public Health. The proposed methodology will create a SDM of the RTW process using feedback relationships of influential components. It will also provide an important simulation tool to understand system behaviour that underlies complex RTW cases, and examine anticipated and unanticipated consequences of disability management policies.","[Jetha, Arif; Pransky, Glenn; Fish, Jon; Jeffries, Susan; Hettinger, Lawrence J.] Liberty Mutual Res Inst Safety, Hopkinton, MA 01748 USA; [Jetha, Arif] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Work Environm, Lowell, MA USA","Jetha, A (reprint author), Liberty Mutual Res Inst Safety, 71 Frankland Rd, Hopkinton, MA 01748 USA.",arif.jetha@libertymutual.com,,,,,"Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; MacEachen E, 2006, SCAND J WORK ENV HEA, V32, P257; MacEachen E, 2010, J OCCUP REHABIL, V20, P349, DOI 10.1007/s10926-010-9229-5; Vennix JAM, 1999, SYST DYNAM REV, V15, P379, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199924)15:4<379::AID-SDR179>3.0.CO;2-E; Loisel P, 2001, DIS MANAG HEALTH OUT, V9, P351, DOI 10.2165/00115677-200109070-00001; Feuerstein M, 2010, J CANCER SURVIV, V4, P415, DOI 10.1007/s11764-010-0154-6; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; Forrester J.

The incidence and severity of tomato diseases varies by production system, and some diseases that result in serious losses in open field systems may be absent in greenhouse-produced tomatoes, and vice versa. We are developing a modified Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) system to manage high-risk diseases in tomato production greenhouses. The approach involves a thorough analysis of risk factors, followed by identification and confirmation of critical points for pathogen entry and dissemination, and identification of preventative best management practices. Using the Delphi process, based on a >= 70% consensus level from a panel of experts, we identified major hazards (including bacterial canker, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) and Botrytis grey mold (B. cinerea), and critical points of entry and dissemination of phytopathogens in tomato propagation and production greenhouses. These include seed, propagation benches, irrigation water, re-used growing medium, non-pollinating insects, tools, equipment, crop debris or culls, and fruit washing and cold storage environments. Sampling strategies were designed and implemented to determine the relevance of each of the identified sources within the production system, and robust diagnostic assays that include target concentration or trapping followed by culturing, serological assays and PCR. Small, medium and large greenhouses in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Canada were identified in order to test potential hazards three times during the growing season. In initial studies, Cmm was detected in harvest and plant debris bins and irrigation water. Botrytis was detected in debris bins, pruning and harvest gloves, ladders used among rows of tomatoes, floors, tomato debris and weeds found inside the greenhouse. Botrytis spores were also detected in several locations by air sampling. Information generated in this study will be used to develop best management practices for greenhouse tomato growers at all production scales.","[Miller, S. A.; Ivey, M. L.

The process of improving healthcare systems involves the necessity to deal with trade-off optimal solutions that take into consideration a multiple number of variables and objectives. Complementing DES with Multi-Objective Optimization (SMO) creates a superior base for finding these solutions and in consequence, facilitates the decision-making process. This paper presents how SMO has been applied for system improvement analysis in a Swedish Emergency Department (ED). A significant number of input variables, constraints and objectives were considered when defining the optimization problem. As a result of the project, the decision makers were provided with a range of optimal solutions which reduces considerably the length of stay and waiting times for the ED patients. SMO has proved to be an appropriate technique to support healthcare system design and improvement processes. A key factor for the success of this project has been the involvement and engagement of the stakeholders during the whole process.","[Uriarte, A. Goienetxea; Zuniga, E. Ruiz; Moris, M. Urenda; Ng, A.

The model presented encompasses multiple variables needed (eg, model building) for the construction of a conceptual system model of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The model tracks the ACA from inception, through passage, March 2010, to its current state. Justification for the need to reform the current health care system rests, in part, on the heels of social justice. Proponents of the ACA have long argued that health reform was needed by the millions of uninsured person who suffered from health disparities, took little advantage of health prevention advice, and faced issues of access to providers as well as insurers. In addition the ACA seeks to address our uncontrollable spending on health care delivery. This article highlights the ACA from a systems perspective. The conceptual model presented encompasses both health reform variables (eg, health care provisions, key legislative components, system environment) and system variables (eg, inputs, outputs, feedback, and throughput) needed to understand current health care reform efforts from a systems perspective. The model presented shows how the interrelationships and interconnections of elements of a system come together to achieve its purpose or goal.","Univ Kentucky, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Sci, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Williams, JC (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Sci, 900 South Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",jcwilliams@uky.edu,,,,,"American Public Health Association, 2012, WHY DO WE NEED AFF C; [Anonymous], 2010, PAT PROT AFF CAR ACT; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Leischow SJ, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P403, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.082842; Boardman J, 2013, SYSTEM THINKING; Carman KG, SURVEY ESTIMATES NET; Haines SG, 1998, SYSTEMS THINKING LEA; Hamel L, KAISER HLTH TRACKING; Krugman P., NYTIMES; Leischow SJ, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, pS196, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.014; Long SK, HLTH REFORM MONITORI; Meadows D., 2008, THINKING SYSTEMS PRI; Minyard KJ, 2014, HLTH SYSTEMS, V3, P1; Park E., OFF CHARTS BLOGS CHA; Robertson L, MILLION LOST INSURAN; Teitelbaum J, 2013, 2013 ANN HLTH REF UP; The Henry J.

We use a social ecological systems approach to investigate connections between human and ecological factors that affect efforts to control the non-native coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) on the island of Hawaii. The coqui frog is recognized as a 'pest' and 'injurious wildlife' by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. Because the coqui occurs on many small private properties across the island, it is necessary to enlist private citizens in control efforts. Control efforts can include direct chemical control of the coqui as well as landscape manipulations that reduce habitat quality for the frog. On 85 private properties in 12 communities across the island, we measured the relationship between coqui abundance, residents' attitudes toward the coqui, their reported participation in control activities, and environmental variables that affect habitat quality for the frog. Residents' attitudes correlated with coqui frog abundance, but in an unexpected direction: People with more frogs on their property and those who owned that property tended to have less negative attitudes toward the coqui. In addition, negative attitudes toward the coqui were not significantly related to participation in control activities. Coqui abundance was related to a habitat variable, canopy cover, which can be manipulated by residents to reduce habitat quality and discourage coqui occupancy. Tolerance for this non-native species is likely to hinder attempts to engage residents in control efforts as the species' range on the island continues to expand. If this pattern of habituation is manifested with other non-native species considered to have potentially negative effects on the ecological or social environment, it would be important to recognize as early as possible because managers may be most effective at engaging citizens in control efforts before habituation becomes widespread.

Computational biologists attempt to understand, predict and manipulate biological system behavior through mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Discrete agent-based modeling (in combination with high-resolution grids to model the extracellular environment) is a popular approach for building biological system models. However, the computational complexity of this approach forces computational biologists to resort to coarser resolution approaches to simulate large biological systems. High-performance parallel computers have the potential to address the computing challenge, but writing efficient software for parallel computers is difficult and time-consuming. Results: We have developed Biocellion, a high-performance software framework, to solve this computing challenge using parallel computers. To support a wide range of multicellular biological system models, Biocellion asks users to provide their model specifics by filling the function body of pre-defined model routines. Using Biocellion, modelers without parallel computing expertise can efficiently exploit parallel computers with less effort than writing sequential programs from scratch. We simulate cell sorting, microbial patterning and a bacterial system in soil aggregate as case studies.","[Kang, Seunghwa; McDermott, Jason] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Computat Biol & Bioinformat Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Kahan, Simon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Flann, Nicholas] Utah State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Shmulevich, Ilya] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Kang, S (reprint author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, Computat Biol & Bioinformat Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",,,,"Extreme Scale Computing Initiative; Fundamental and Computational Sciences Directorate; Technology Investment Program, Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); DOE [DE-ACO5-76RLO 1830]","Support for this research was provided by the Extreme Scale Computing Initiative, the Fundamental and Computational Sciences Directorate and the Technology Investment Program, as part of the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

Energy system analysis tools incorporate environmental, economic, energy and engineering analysis of future energy systems and are considered crucial for the quantitative assessment of transitional scenarios towards future milestones, such as EU 2020 goals and Denmark's goal of achieving fossil free society after 2050. The present paper shows how a Danish heat atlas can be used for providing inputs to energy system models, especially related to the analysis of heat saving measures within building stock and expansion of district heating networks. As a result, marginal cost curves are created, approximated and prepared for the use in optimization energy system model. Moreover, it is concluded that heat atlas can contribute as a tool for data storage and visualisation of results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A systems level understanding of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-leptin axis may reveal novel insights. Eighteen obese premenopausal women provided blood samples every 10 min over 24 h, which were assayed for cortisol, adrenocorticotropin releasing hormone (ACTH) and leptin. A published personalized HPA systems model was extended to incorporate leptin, yielding three parameters: (i) cortisol inhibitory feedback signalling, (ii) ACTH-adrenal signalling, and (iii) leptin-cortisol antagonism. We investigated associations between these parameters and metabolic risk profiles: fat and lean body mass (LBM; using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and insulin resistance. Decreased cortisol inhibitory feedback signalling was significantly associated with greater fat (kg; p = 0.01) and insulin resistance (p = 0.03) but not LBM. Leptin significantly antagonized cortisol dynamics in eight women, who exhibited significantly lower 24 h mean leptin levels, LBM and higher ACTH-adrenal signalling nocturnally (all p < 0.05), compared with women without antagonism. Traditional neuroendocrine measures did not predict metabolic health, whereas a dynamic systems approach revealed that lower central inhibitory cortisol feedback signalling was significantly associated with greater metabolic risk. While exploratory, leptin-cortisol antagonism may reflect a 'neuroendocrine starvation' response.","[Aschbacher, Kirstin; Epel, Elissa] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Aschbacher, Kirstin] Inst Integrat Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Rodriguez-Fernandez, Maria; Doyle, Francis J., III] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [van Wietmarschen, Herman; van der Greef, Jan] TNO Innovat Life, Zeist, Netherlands; [van Wietmarschen, Herman; van der Greef, Jan] Leiden Univ, Dept Analyt Biosci, Leiden, Netherlands; [Tomiyama, A.

It is often difficult to anticipate, at the outset, the consequences of design decisions on the ultimate effectiveness of such complex systems, in which case the evaluation process is required to support the designers each time engineering choices must be made or justified. Since designers may belong to different technical and scientific cultures however, their understanding of both the design stakes and the evaluation process is too often biased. Moreover, design choices take place in an uncertain context and according to multiple criteria, some of which may be contradictory. In order to track the consequences of design decisions, we are proposing a conceptual data model to perform evaluations within the MBSE framework of Systems Engineering. We then proceed by relying on the relationships demonstrated by such a model to identify the potential impacts of design choices on future product performance. Since data available during the conceptual phase of the design are typically uncertain or imprecise, an original research protocol is extended to a qualitative impact analysis for the purpose of highlighting the most promising alternative system design solutions (ASDS). An example in the mechatronics field serves to illustrate our proposals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Addressing the challenges facing this complex endeavor requires more than modifications of individual processes; it requires a fully integrated application of systems thinking and an understanding of the desired goals and complex interactions among essential components and stakeholders of the whole. A multistakeholder collaborative effort, led by the Alliance for Clinical Research Excellence and Safety (ACRES), a global nonprofit organization operating in the public interest, is now under way to build a shared global system for clinical research. Its systems approach focuses on the interconnection of stakeholders at critical points of interaction within 4 operational domains: site development and support, quality management, information technology, and safety. The ACRES initiatives, Site Accreditation and Standards, Product Safety Culture, Global Ethical Review and Regulatory Innovation, and Quality Assurance and Safety, focus on building and implementing systems solutions. Underpinning these initiatives is an open, shared, integrated technology (site and optics and quality informatics initiative). Findings: We describe the rationale, challenges,. progress, and successes of this effort to date and lessons learned. The complexity and fragmentation of the intensely proprietary ecosystem of drug development, challenging regulatory climate, and magnitude of the endeavor itself pose significant challenges, but the economic, social, and scientific rewards will more than justify the effort.

This is relevant because systems failures in healthcare delivery generate medical errors and avoidable adverse events, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and wasting billions of dollars annually. The Institute of Medicine calls for collaboration across disciplines to spread systems engineering within healthcare; however, few physician educators possess the necessary expertise to teach these methods. In this article, we describe a novel systems engineering and quality improvement training partnership between engineers and practicing clinicians. This curriculum effectively increased knowledge in systems thinking, provided direct experience utilizing improvement tools, and enhanced care delivery. Through coupling the interests and resources of engineering faculty and the residency training program, we were able to build an effective training program that empowers front-line staff to identify and act on systems-based patient safety problems.

Although not new to the field of epidemiology, two frameworks that provide epidemiologists with a foundation for understanding the complex contexts in which programs and policies are implemented were presented to maternal and child health (MCH) professionals at the 2012 co-hosted 18th Annual MCH Epidemiology Conference and 22nd CityMatCH Urban Leadership Conference. The complex systems approach offers researchers in MCH the opportunity to understand the functioning of social, medical, environmental, and behavioral factors within the context of implemented public health programs. Implementation science provides researchers with a framework to translate the evidence-based program interventions into practices and policies that impact health outcomes. Both approaches offer MCH epidemiologists conceptual frameworks with which to re-envision how programs are implemented, monitored, evaluated, and reported to the larger public health audience. By using these approaches, researchers can begin to understand and measure the broader public health context, account for the dynamic interplay of the social environment, and ultimately, develop more effective MCH programs and policies.","[Kroelinger, Charlan D.; Grigorescu, Violanda] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Reprod Hlth, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Chamblee, GA 30341 USA; [Rankin, Kristin M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL USA; [Chambers, David A.] NIMH, Div Serv & Intervent Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Roux, Ana V.

Embracing requirements in a product line's asset base enhances the effectiveness of reuse as engineers can work on the abstractions closer to the domain's initial concepts. Conventional proactive approaches to product line engineering cause excessive overhead when codifying the assets. In this paper, we propose a systems-oriented approach to extracting functional requirements profiles. The validated extraction constructs are amenable to semantic case analysis and orthogonal variability modeling, so as to uncover the variation structure and constraints. To evaluate our approach, we present an experiment to quantify the extraction overhead and effectiveness and a case study to assess our approach's usefulness. The results show that our automatic support offers an order-of-magnitude saving over the manual extraction effort without significantly compromising quality and that our approach receives a positive adoption rate by systems engineers.","[Niu, Nan] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Savolainen, Juha] Danfoss Power Elect AS, DK-6300 Grasten, Denmark; [Niu, Zhendong] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Jin, Mingzhou] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Informat Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Cheng, Jing-Ru C.] US Army Engn Res & Dev Ctr, Informat Technol Lab, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA","Niu, N (reprint author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",niu@cse.msstate.edu; JuhaErik.Savolainen@danfoss.com; zniu@bit.edu.cn; jin@utk.edu; ruth.c.cheng@usace.army.mil,,"Niu, Nan/0000-0001-5566-2368",U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center [W912HZ-10-C-0101]; U.S. Department of Transportation [DTOS59-09-G-00058]; U.S. National Science Foundation [CCF-1238336],"This research is supported in part by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center under Grant W912HZ-10-C-0101, by the U.S. Department of Transportation under Grant DTOS59-09-G-00058, and by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-1238336.","Krueger C, 2002, IEEE SOFTWARE, V19, P29, DOI 10.1109/MS.2002.1020284; Stone A, 2011, IEEE SYST J, V5, P111, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2010.2073954; Engelsman W, 2011, ENTERP INF SYST-UK, V5, P9, DOI 10.1080/17517575.2010.491871; Morgan DL, 1996, ANNU REV SOCIOL, V22, P129, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.129; Moon M, 2005, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V31, P551; Niu N, 2011, ENTERP INF SYST-UK, V5, P183, DOI 10.1080/17517575.2010.519052; Bockle G, 2004, IEEE SOFTWARE, V21, P23; Niu N, 2007, IEEE SOFTWARE, V24, P53, DOI 10.1109/MS.2007.52; Quartel D, 2012, ENTERP INF SYST-UK, V6, P189, DOI 10.1080/17517575.2011.625571; Corsello MA, 2008, IEEE SYST J, V2, P312, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2008.925972; Ip WH, 2011, IEEE SYST J, V5, P189, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2010.2096670; Niu N, 2008, INT REQUIR ENG CONF, P155, DOI 10.1109/RE.2008.49; Rahnama H, 2011, IEEE SYST J, V5, P80, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2010.2065093; Mostafavi A, 2011, IEEE SYST J, V5, P256, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2011.2131050; Niu N, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4620, P40; Clements P., 2001, SOFTWARE PRODUCT LIN; Fillmore C., 1968, UNIVERSALS LINGUIST, P1; Fonoage M, 2010, IEEE SYST J, V4, P396, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2010.2055030; Grieux G., 2009, IEEE SYST J, V3, P199; Halmans G., 2003, SOFTWARE SYSTEMS MOD, V2, P15, DOI 10.1007/s10270-003-0019-9; IEEE Standards Board, 1998, 8301998 IEEE; John I., 2001, P INT WORKSH PROD FA, P113; Kang K, 1990, CMUSEI90TR21; Krippendorff K., 1980, CONTENT ANAL INTRO I; Li LS, 2012, ENTERP INF SYST-UK, V6, P345, DOI 10.1080/17517575.2011.651627; Liaskos S., 2006, P 14 IEEE INT REQ EN, P79; Luisa M., 2004, Requirements Engineering, V9, DOI 10.1007/s00766-003-0179-8; MAAREK YS, 1991, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V17, P800, DOI 10.1109/32.83915; Mahmoud A., 2010, P IEEE INT C IRI LAS, P330; Martin W., 1983, LEXICOGRAPHY PRINCIP; Mietzner R, 2011, ENTERP INF SYST-UK, V5, P59, DOI 10.1080/17517575.2010.492950; Niu N, 2009, AOSD'09: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASPECT-ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, P137; Parnas D.

The way providers are paid is a critical part of this process because it can create incentives and patterns of behaviour related to supply. The objective of this work was to describe provider behaviour related to supply of health services to insured clients in Ghana and the influence of provider payment methods on incentives and behaviour. Methods: A mixed methods study involving grey and published literature reviews, as well as health management information system and primary data collection and analysis was used. Primary data collection involved in-depth interviews, observations of time spent obtaining service, prescription analysis, and exit interviews with clients. Qualitative data was analysed manually to draw out themes, commonalities, and contrasts. Quantitative data was analysed in Excel and Stata. Causal loop and cause tree diagrams were used to develop a qualitative explanatory model of provider supply incentives and behaviour related to payment method in context. Results: There are multiple provider payment methods in the Ghanaian health system. National Health Insurance provider payment methods are the most recent additions. At the time of the study, the methods used nationwide were the Ghana Diagnostic Related Groupings payment for services and an itemized and standardized fee schedule for medicines. The influence of provider payment method on supply behaviour was sometimes intuitive and sometimes counter intuitive. It appeared to be related to context and the interaction of the methods with context and each other rather than linearly to any given method. Conclusions: As countries work towards Universal Health Coverage, there is a need to holistically design, implement, and manage provider payment methods reforms from systems rather than linear perspectives, since the latter fail to recognize the effects of context and the between-methods and context interactions in producing net effects.","[Agyepong, Irene A.; Aryeetey, Geneieve C.; Nonvignon, Justice; Esena, Reuben; Aikins, Moses] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management HPPM, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Asenso-Boadi, Francis] Natl Hlth Insurance Author, Accra, Ghana; [Antwi, Edward] Ghana Hlth Serv Greater Accra Reg Hlth Directorat, Accra, Ghana; [Ankrah, Daniel] Korle Bu Teaching Hosp, Accra, Ghana; [Adjei-Acquah, Charles] Ghana Hlth Serv, PPMED, Accra, Ghana; [Arhinful, Daniel K.] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Legon, Accra, Ghana","Agyepong, IA (reprint author), Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management HPPM, POB LG 13, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",iagyepong@hotmail.com,,,,,"Jehu-Appiah C, 2011, SOC SCI MED, V72, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.025; Jegers M, 2002, HEALTH POLICY, V60, P255, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8510(01)00216-0; [Anonymous], 2011, SSNIT ANN REP 2011; Kutzin J, 2001, HEALTH POLICY, V56, P171, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8510(00)00149-4; Agyepong IA, 2008, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V23, P150, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czn002; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Agyepong IA, 2011, HEALTH POLICY, V99, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.09.018; Bhutta ZA, 2010, LANCET, V375, P2032, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60678-2; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; WHO, 2010, WORLD MALARIA REPORT 2010, P1; McIntyre D, 2008, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V86, P871, DOI 10.2471/BLT.08.053413; [Anonymous], 2013, SYSTEMS BEHAV CAUSAL; Jehu-Appiah C, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P222, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr032; Ansah EK, 2009, PLOS MED, V6, P232, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000033; Arhinful DK, 2009, MINISTRY HLTH GHANA; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Gauri V, 2001, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V2624; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2004, NAT HLTH INS POL FRA; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2013, HOL ASS HLTH SECT PR; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2002, NAT HLTH INS POL FRA; Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) Ghana Health Service (GHS) and ICF Macro, 2008, GHAN DEM HLTH SURV; Hesse A, 2007, NATL HLTH INSURANCE; Index Mundi, 2013, INDEX MUNDI; Kipp R, 2013, DEV NATIONS CAN GAIN; Mathauer I, 2012, DRG BASED PAYMENT SY; Pawson R, 1997, REALISTIC EVALUATION; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P746; Senge P.M., 1990, 5 DISCIPLINE ART PRA; Sodzi-Tettey S, 2012, Ghana Med J, V46, P189; UN, 2012, UN GEN ASS 67 SESS A; WHO, 2006, WORK TOG HLTH WORLD; WHO (World Health Organisation), 2005, SUST HLTH FIN UN COV; Witter S, 2009, BMC INT HEALTH HUM R, V9, DOI 10.1186/1472-698X-9-20",33,2,2,1,10,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-4505,,,HEALTH RES POLICY SY,Health Res.

The microarray study measured the expression of 13,964 genes in the hypothalamus of Brahman cows. A total of 366 genes were differentially expressed (DE) in the post-partum period, when acyclic cows were compared to cows that had resumed ovarian cycles. Associated markers (P < 0.05) from a high density GWAS pointed to 2829 genes that were associated with post-partum anoestrous interval (PPAI) in two populations of beef cattle: Brahman and Tropical composite. Together the experiments provided evidence for 63 genes that are likely to influence the resumption of ovulation post-partum in tropically adapted beef cattle. Functional annotation analysis revealed that some of the 63 genes have known roles in hormonal activity, energy balance and neuronal synapse plasticity. Polymorphisms within candidate genes identified by this systems approach could have biological significance in post-partum anoestrus and help select Zebu (Bos indicus) influenced cattle with genetic potential for shorter post-partum anoestrus.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors related with delays in the treatment of STEMI patients to support a strategic plan toward structural and personnel modifications in a primary hospital aligning its process with international guidelines. Methods and Findings: The study was conducted in a primary hospital localized in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil. We utilized a qualitative and quantitative integrated analysis including on-site observations, interviews, medical records analysis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and System Dynamics Modeling (SD). Main cause of delays were categorized into three themes: a) professional, b) equipment and c) transportation logistics. QCA analysis confirmed four main stages of delay to STEMI patient's care in relation to the 'Door-in-Door-out' time at the primary hospital. These stages and their average delays in minutes were: a) First Medical Contact (From Door-In to the first contact with the nurse and/or physician): 7 minutes; b) Electrocardiogram acquisition and review by a physician: 28 minutes; c) ECG transmission and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Center team feedback time: 76 minutes; and d) Patient's Transfer Waiting Time: 78 minutes. SD baseline model confirmed the system's behavior with all occurring delays and the need of improvements. Moreover, after model validation and sensitivity analysis, results suggested that an overall improvement of 40% to 50% in each of these identified stages would reduce the delay. Conclusions: This evaluation suggests that investment in health personnel training, diminution of bureaucracy, and management of guidelines might lead to important improvements decreasing the delay of STEMI patients' care. In addition, this work provides evidence that SD modeling may highlight areas where health system managers can implement and evaluate the necessary changes in order to improve the process of care.","[de Andrade, Luciano; de Barros Carvalho, Maria Dalva] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Hlth Sci, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Lynch, Catherine] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Dept Surg, Div Emergency Med, Durham, NC USA; [Carvalho, Elias] Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Carvalho, Elias] Pontificia Univ Catolica PUC PR, Knowledge Discovery & Machine Learning Grp, Grad Program Informat PPGIA, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [de Andrade, Luciano; Nihei, Oscar Kenji] State Univ West Parana, Dept Nursing, Foz Do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Clarissa Garcia] Fundacao Univ Cardiol, Inst Cardiol Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Nickenig Vissoci, Joao Ricardo] Fac Inga, Dept Med, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Passos, Guttenberg Ferreira] Univ Brasilia, Dept Informat, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Pietrobon, Ricardo] Duke Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Surg, Durham, NC USA","Carvalho, MDD (reprint author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Hlth Sci, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",kiracarva@gmail.com,,,"Science Without Borders Program, Brazilian Government","LA and JRNV were funded by the Science Without Borders Program, Brazilian Government (http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/).

On the basis of this kinetic feature, the nucleation is one of the most crucial phases controlling the pathogenesis of amyloidoses, but little is known about the details of how protein molecules and surrounding environment vary at this stage. Here, we applied near infrared (NIR) spectral monitoring of water structural changes in real time during the nucleation-dependent fibrillation of insulin. Whilst multivariate spectral analysis in the 2050-2350 nm spectral region indicated cross-beta formation, characteristic transformations of water structure have been detected in the spectral region 1300-1600 nm corresponding to the first overtone of water OH stretching vibrations. Furthermore, specific water spectral patterns (aquagrams) related to different water molecular conformations have been found along the course of protein nucleation and aggregation. Right in the beginning, dissociation of hydrogen-bonded network in bulk water and coinstantaneous protein and ion hydration were observed, followed by water hydrogen-bonded networks development, presumably forcing the nucleation. These specific transformations of water spectral pattern could be used further as a biomarker for early non-invasive diagnosis of amyloidoses prior to explosive amplification and deposits of amyloid fibrils.","[Chatani, Eri; Masuda, Yuki] Kobe Univ, Dept Chem, Grad Sch Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Tsuchisaka, Yutaro; Tsenkova, Roumiana] Kobe Univ, Dept Environm Informat & Bioprod Engn, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan","Chatani, E (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Dept Chem, Grad Sch Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",chatani@crystal.kobe-u.ac.jp; rtsen@kobe-u.ac.jp,,,MEXT KAKENHI [25440071]; Naito Foundation; Kobe University Innovation Center,"This work was supported, in part, by MEXT KAKENHI Grant Number 25440071, Grant from the Naito Foundation for E.C., and Kobe University Innovation Center Grant for R.T.

Our objective was to create a system dynamics model specific to weight gain and obesity in women of reproductive age that could inform future health policies and have the potential for use in preconception interventions targeting obese women. Methods. We used our system dynamics model of obesity in women to test various strategies for family building, including ovulation induction versus weight loss to improve ovulation. Outcomes included relative fecundability, postpartum body mass index, and mortality. Results. Our system dynamics model demonstrated that obese women who become pregnant exhibit increasing obesity levels over time with elevated morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, obese women who lose weight prior to pregnancy have improved reproductive outcomes but may risk an age-related decline in fertility, which can affect overall family size. Conclusions. Our model highlights important public health issues regarding obesity in women of reproductive age. The model may be useful in preconception counseling of obese women who are attempting to balance the competing risks associated with age-related declines in fertility and clinically meaningful weight loss.","[Sabounchi, Nasim S.;

Methods: A modeled population is subject to only two diseases. Disease A is a curable disease that can be shortened by curative care. Disease B is an instantly fatal but preventable disease. Curative care workers are financed by public spending and private fees to cure disease A. Non-personal, preventive services are delivered by public health workers supported solely by public spending to prevent disease B. Each type of worker tries to tilt the balance of government spending towards their interests. Their influence on the government is proportional to their accumulated revenue. Results: The model demonstrates effects on lost disability-adjusted life years and costs over the course of several epidemics of each disease. Policy interventions are tested including: i) an outside donor rationally donates extra money to each type of disease precisely in proportion to the size of epidemics of each disease; ii) lobbying is eliminated; iii) fees for personal health services are eliminated; iv) the government continually rebalances the funding for prevention by ring-fencing it to protect it from lobbying. The model exhibits a ""spend more get less"" equilibrium in which higher revenue by the curative sector is used to influence government allocations away from prevention towards cure. Spending more on curing disease A leads paradoxically to a higher overall disease burden of unprevented cases of disease B. This paradoxical behavior of the model can be stopped by eliminating lobbying, eliminating fees for curative services, and ring-fencing public health funding. Conclusions: We have created an artificial system as a laboratory to gain insights about the trade-offs between curative and preventive health allocations, and the effect of indicative policy interventions. The underlying dynamics of this artificial system resemble features of modern health systems where a self-perpetuating industry has grown up around disease-specific curative programs like HIV/AIDS or malaria. The model shows how the growth of curative care services can crowd both fiscal and policy space for the practice of population level prevention work, requiring dramatic interventions to overcome these trends.","[Bishai, David; Li, Qingfeng] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Paina, Ligia; Peters, David H.; Hyder, Adnan A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bishai, David; Li, Qingfeng; Hyder, Adnan A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Int Injury Res Unit, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Bishai, D (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,Room E4622, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dbishai1@jhu.edu,,"Peters, David/0000-0001-8377-3444",,,"Swanson RC, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P54, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs090; Merrill JA, 2013, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V20, pE131, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001289; Hipgrave DB, 2014, SOC SCI MED, V102, P190, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.056; Grepin KA, 2012, HEALTH AFFAIR, V31, P1406, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0279; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Neumann PJ, 2004, AM J MANAG CARE, V10, P308; [Anonymous], 2010, 2 ESS PUBL HLTH FUNC; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Hunsmann M, 2012, SOC SCI MED, V74, P1477, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.01.023; Anand S, 2002, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V56, P485, DOI 10.1136/jech.56.7.485; Loue S, 2006, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V60, P458, DOI 10.1136/jech.2004.023044; Walker N, 2013, LANCET, V382, P1029, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61748-1; Case A, 2011, DEMOGRAPHY, V48, P675, DOI 10.1007/s13524-011-0026-3; [Anonymous], 1968, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V205, P868; Bishai D, 2003, HEALTH ECON, V12, P415, DOI 10.1002/hec.732; Barber P, 2010, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V8, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-8-24; Bevan D, 2007, PROMOTING PROTECTING; Bishai D, 2003, WHAT IS IMPACT VITAM; Boama V, 2009, INT J GYNECOL OBSTET, V106, P125, DOI 10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.03.023; Briscombe B, 2010, IMPROVING RESOURCE A; Centers for Disease Cotrol, 1992, MMWR-MORBID MORTAL W, V41, P529; Department of Health UK, 2010, EQ EXC LIB NHS; Epstein J.

After a short presentation of the PSE methods and the bioprocess development drivers, three case studies are presented. In the first example it is demonstrated how experimental investigations of the hi-enzymatic production of lactobionic acid can be modeled with help of a new mechanistic mathematical model. The reaction was performed at lab scale and the prediction quality analyzed. In the second example a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is used to study mass transfer phenomena in a microreactor. In this example the model is not only used to predict the transient dynamics of the reactor system but also to extract material properties like the diffusion velocities of substrate and product, which is otherwise difficult to access. In the last example, a new approach to the design of microbioreactor layouts using topology optimization is presented and discussed. Finally, the PSE methods are carefully discussed with respect to the complexity of the presented approaches, the applicability with respect to practical considerations and the opportunity to analyze experimental results and transfer the knowledge between different scales.","[Kruhne, U.; Larsson, H.; Heintz, S.; Ringborg, R.

Other than a few well characterized environmental agents linked to specific cancers, linkage between any particular environmental exposure and a specific type of cancer is mostly unknown. Thus, we propose a systems approach to analyze publicly available large datasets to identify candidate agents that play a role in organ-specific carcinogenesis. Methods: Publicly available datasets for mRNA and miRNA expression in ovarian cancer were queried to define the differentially expressed genes that are also targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. These target genes were then used to query the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database to identify interacting chemicals and also were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify pathways. Results: The interacting chemicals interact with genes in known pathways in ovarian carcinogenesis and support the hypothesis that these chemicals are likely etiologic agents in ovarian carcinogenesis. Conclusion: A systems approach may prove useful to identify specific etiologic agents to better develop personalized preventive medicine strategies for those most at risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The true magnitude of hypertension in some West African countries, including in-depth knowledge of underlying risk factors is not completely understood. There is also a paucity of research on adequate systems-level approaches designed to mitigate the growing burden of hypertension in the region. Aims: In this review, we thematically synthesize available literature pertaining to the prevalence of hypertension in West Africa and discuss factors that influence its diagnosis, treatment and control. We aimed to address the social and structural determinants influencing hypertension in the sub-region including the effects of urbanization, health infrastructure and healthcare workforce. Findings: The prevalence of hypertension in West Africa has increased over the past decade and is rising rapidly with an urban-rural gradient that places higher hypertension prevalence on urban settings compared to rural settings. Overall levels of awareness of one's hypertension status remain consistently low in West African. Structural and economic determinants related to conditions of poverty such as insufficient finances have a direct impact on adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. Urbanization contributes to the increasing incidence of hypertension in the sub-region and available evidence indicates that inadequate health infrastructure may act as a barrier to optimal hypertension control in West Africa. Conclusion: Given that optimal hypertension control in West Africa depends on multiple factors that go beyond simply modifying the behaviors of the individuals alone, we conclude by discussing the potential role systems-thinking approaches can play to achieve optimal control in the sub-region. In the context of recent advances in hypertension management including new therapeutic options and innovative solutions to expand health workforce so as to meet the high demand for healthcare, the success of these strategies will rely on a new understanding of the complexity of human behaviors and interactions most aptly framed from a systems-thinking perspective.","[Iwelunmor, Juliet] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Airhihenbuwa, Collins O.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biobehav Hlth, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Cooper, Richard; Tayo, Bamidele] Loyola Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Plange-Rhule, Jacob] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Coll Hlth Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Adanu, Richard] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Healthful Behav Change,Div Gen Internal Med, New York, NY USA","Iwelunmor, J (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 123 Huff Hall,1206 S Fourth St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",jiwez@illinois.edu,,, [D43TW009140],This work was supported in part by Grant #D43TW009140 (PI: Ogedegbe).,"Adediran O, 2012, J Cardiovasc Dis Res, V3, P191, DOI 10.4103/0975-3583.98890; Agyepong Irene Akua, 2012, Health Policy Plan, V27 Suppl 4, piv20, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs083; Airhihenbuwa C., 1995, HLTH CULTURE W PARAD; Amira C O, 2007, Niger Postgrad Med J, V14, P325; Anderson V., 1997, SYSTEMS THINKING BAS; Niakara A, 2007, T ROY SOC TROP MED H, V101, P1136, DOI 10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.07.002; Addo J, 2006, ETHNIC DIS, V16, P894; Osamor PE, 2011, J HEALTH POPUL NUTR, V29, P619; Mendis S, 2004, J HYPERTENS, V22, P59, DOI 10.1097/01.hjh.0000098150.70956.af; Ogah OS, 2013, HEART, V99, P1390, DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303227; BeLue R, 2012, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V39, P745, DOI 10.1177/1090198111430708; Opie LH, 2005, CIRCULATION, V112, P3562, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.539569; Agyemang C, 2006, PUBLIC HEALTH, V120, P525, DOI 10.1016/j.puhe.2006.02.002; Twagirumukiza M, 2011, J HYPERTENS, V29, P1243, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e328346995d; Daniel OJ, 2013, J URBAN HEALTH, V90, P1016, DOI 10.1007/s11524-013-9795-x; Odedosu T, 2012, CLEV CLIN J MED, V79, P46, DOI 10.3949/ccjm.79a.11068; Buabeng KO, 2004, J PHARM PHARM SCI, V7, P350; Ibrahim MM, 2012, LANCET, V380, P611, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60861-7; Airhihenbuwa CO, 2014, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V41, P78, DOI 10.1177/1090198113487199; Kaufman JS, 1996, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V143, P1203; Belue R, 2009, GLOBALIZATION HEALTH, V5, DOI 10.1186/1744-8603-5-10; Owolabi MO, 2011, W INDIAN MED J, V60, P412; Houinato DS, 2012, REV EPIDEMIOL SANTE, V60, P95, DOI 10.1016/j.respe.2011.09.010; Leischow SJ, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P403, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.082842; Agyemang C, 2006, J HUM HYPERTENS, V20, P67, DOI 10.1038/sj.jhh.1001923; Addo J, 2007, HYPERTENSION, V50, P1012, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.093336; Lekoubou A, 2010, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V7, P353, DOI 10.3390/ijerph7020353; Armstead CA, 2010, REGULATION, V20, P251; Balde M D, 2006, Mali Med, V21, P19; Bosu WK, 2010, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-10-418; Cook-Huynh M, 2012, ETHNIC DIS, V22, P347; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Duboz P, 2012, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V149, P250, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.22122; ECOWAS, 2006, REG INT GROWTH POV R, P220; Ejike CE, 2008, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V8, P411; Ekezie J, 2011, AM J MED SCI, V3, P242; Gyakobo M, 2012, BMC ENDOCR DISORD, V12, DOI 10.1186/1472-6823-12-25; Harries T, 2005, J HUM HYPERTENS, V19, P975; Ilesanmi OS, 2013, PAN AFR MED J, V12; Isezuo S, 2010, J HUM HYPERTENS, V25, P224; Kuper H, 1965, URBANIZATION MIGRATI; Mendis S, 2010, EQUITY, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMMES, P31; Niakara A, 2003, Bull Soc Pathol Exot, V96, P219; Omuemu V, 2008, NIGER J CLIN PRACT, V10, P208; Ono Agbani Ejaife, 2006, Sao Paulo Med J, V124, P105, DOI 10.1590/S1516-31802006000200011; Parker A, 2011, CARDIOVASC J AFR, V22, P186, DOI 10.5830/CVJA-2010-066; POBEE JOM, 1977, T ROY SOC TROP MED H, V71, P66, DOI 10.1016/0035-9203(77)90211-5; Sabate E, 2003, ADHERENCE LONG TERM; Sodjinou R, 2008, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V8, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-8-84; Sturmberg JP, 2007, AUST FAM PHYSICIAN, V36, P170; Thomas J, 2008, BMC MED RES METHODOL, V8, P45, DOI DOI 10.1186/1471-2288-8-45; UNESA, 2011, WORLD URB PROSP 2011; WILSON TW, 1986, LANCET, V1, P784; Yayehd K, 2012, ANN CARDIOL ANGEIOL, V62, P43; Yusuff KB, 2005, J PHARM PHARM SCI, V8, P235",55,7,8,3,17,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1744-8603,,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

Opt. 52, 4151 (2013)], we presented the first-and second-order derivatives of a ray for a flat boundary surface to design prisms. In this paper, that scheme is extended to determine the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of a skew ray as it is reflected/refracted at a spherical boundary surface. The validity of the proposed approach as an analysis and design tool is demonstrated using an axissymmetrical system for illustration purpose. It is found that these two matrices can provide the search direction used by existing gradient-based schemes to minimize the merit function during the optimization stage of the optical system design process. It is also possible to make the optical system designs more automatic, if the image defects can be extracted from the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of a skew ray.

Together with experimental studies, numerical modeling has been traditionally used to acquire mechanistic insights in this research area. This review summarizes the present state of numerical modeling of the cardiac pacemaker, including approaches to resolve present paradoxes and controversies. Specifically we discuss the requirement for realistic modeling to consider symmetrical importance of both intracellular and cell membrane processes (within a recent ""coupled-clock"" theory). Promising future developments of the complex pacemaker system models include the introduction of local calcium control, mitochondria function, and biochemical regulation of protein phosphorylation and cAMP production. Modern numerical and theoretical methods such as multi-parameter sensitivity analyses within extended populations of models and bifurcation analyses are also important for the definition of the most realistic parameters that describe a robust, yet simultaneously flexible operation of the coupled-clock pacemaker cell system. The systems approach to exploring cardiac pacemaker function will guide development of new therapies such as biological pacemakers for treating insufficient cardiac pacemaker function that becomes especially prevalent with advancing age.","[Maltsev, Victor A.;

In the preceding Bench narrative, Kudva and colleagues provide an in-depth understanding of the modified glucoregulatory physiology of type 1 diabetes that will help refine future AP algorithms. In the Clinic narrative presented here, we compare and evaluate AP technology to gain further momentum toward outpatient trials and eventual approval for widespread use. We enumerate the design objectives, variables, and challenges involved in AP development, concluding with a discussion of recent clinical advancements. Thanks to the effective integration of engineering and medicine, the dream of automated glucose regulation is nearing reality.

However, the complexity of these socio-ecological factors is often poorly understood. This study identifies the socio-ecological factors influencing land-cover change in the ex-Mega Rice Project area of Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A systems thinking approach was used to construct two causal loop diagrams to assess the interrelationships between land-cover change, actors' choice and their motivation to convert land cover. The analysis reveals that current community livelihood activities to improve welfare and maintain food availability are the main endogenous drivers of land-and forest-cover change in the study area. Unintentional fire resulting from uncontrolled slash-and-burn practices by local communities is the main mechanism of forest-cover change. Land tenure uncertainty has also accelerated community land claiming using fire. Our analysis indicates that forest access, commodity prices and rainfall patterns are dominant exogenous drivers of land-cover change. Programmes that emphasize sustainable sources of food and income for local communities in conjunction with physical peatland restoration activities, such as drainage canal-blocking and reforestation, should be the key features of interventions aimed at preventing further peatland degradation.","[Medrilzam, Medrilzam; Dargusch, Paul] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Herbohn, John; Smith, Carl] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Herbohn, John] So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia","Medrilzam, M (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.medrilzam@uq.edu.au,,,,,"Akbar A., 2011, PENELITIAN SOSIAL DA, V8, P211; Folke C, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.002; Schluter M, 2012, NAT RESOUR MODEL, V25, P219, DOI 10.1111/j.1939-7445.2011.00108.x; Flood RL, 2010, SYST PRACT ACT RES, V23, P269, DOI 10.1007/s11213-010-9169-1; Liu JG, 2007, SCIENCE, V317, P1513, DOI 10.1126/science.1144004; McCarthy JF, 2000, DEV CHANGE, V31, P91, DOI 10.1111/1467-7660.00148; Checkland P, 2010, SYSTEMS APPROACHES TO MANAGING CHANGE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE, P191, DOI 10.1007/978-1-84882-809-4_5; Yauch CA, 2003, ORGAN RES METHODS, V6, P465, DOI 10.1177/1094428103257362; Galudra G, 2011, INT FOREST REV, V13, P431, DOI 10.1505/146554811798811380; Vennix JAM, 1999, SYST DYNAM REV, V15, P379, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199924)15:4<379::AID-SDR179>3.0.CO;2-E; Vennix JAM, 1996, SYST DYNAM REV, V12, P39, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199621)12:1<39::AID-SDR94>3.0.CO;2-K; Page SE, 2011, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL, V17, P798, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02279.x; Jaenicke J, 2008, GEODERMA, V147, P151, DOI 10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.08.008; Langmann B, 2004, ATMOS CHEM PHYS, V4, P2145; Hadi A, 2005, NUTR CYCL AGROECOSYS, V71, P73, DOI 10.1007/s10705-004-0380-2; Douglas I, 2006, GEOGR RES-AUST, V44, P123, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-5871.2006.00373.x; Hirano T, 2007, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL, V13, P412, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01301.x; Page S, 2009, ECOSYSTEMS, V12, P888, DOI 10.1007/s10021-008-9216-2; Aldhous P, 2004, NATURE, V432, P144, DOI 10.1038/432144a; Lestrelin G, 2010, LAND USE POLICY, V27, P424, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2009.06.005; McCarthy JF, 2004, WORLD DEV, V32, P1199, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.02.002; Page SE, 2002, NATURE, V420, P61, DOI 10.1038/nature01131; Anshari G.

Faced with decreasing product prices and increasing production costs during the last two decades family farmers in south Uruguay tried to maintain their income by intensifying their farms, growing larger areas of fewer crops and increasing the use of irrigation and agrochemicals. Soil degradation was aggravated by this process, limiting crop yields, undermining the farmers' aim of maintaining their income. A model-aided explorative study had shown that decreasing the area of vegetables, introducing crop rotations, cover crops and manure applications, and including beef-cattle production would be a better strategy. To test this hypothesis, a project was started at the end of 2004 and expanded in 2007, involving farmers, technical advisers and scientists in a co-innovation process that combined systemic diagnosis and redesign of the farm systems, social learning and dynamic monitoring and evaluation. The project involved 14 farms representing a large range of variation in resource endowment. Main problems found on all farms were deteriorated soil quality and low labour productivity, which resulted in low income and high work load. At the end of 2-5 years of redesign farmers had been able to implement most innovations planned. Irrespective of endowment with land, machinery, irrigation water or labour resources, re-design increased the per capita family income (Flp) and the income per hour of family labour (IH) on 13 out of 14 farms, by 51% and 50%, respectively, averaged over all farms. Soil organic carbon content had increased on 11 out of 14 farms and estimated erosion rates in vegetable fields had halved. Farmers considered 'multi-year planning' the most important change introduced into their practice by the project. They concluded that the role of the extension service agents should change from mere consultants of operational-tactical, crop-centred decisions to supporters of the process of farm planning and evaluation. The project showed that even on commercial farms operating under highly competitive conditions, substantial improvements in economic and environmental indicators can be achieved when a whole farm strategic redesign is elaborated.

National drug authorities can use such techniques to take care of their deficiencies in decision making processes. This study was designed to build a system dynamics model to simulate the effects of market mix variables (5 P's) on the national drug policy (NDP) indicators including availability, affordability, quality, and rationality. This was aimed to investigate how to increase the rationality of decision making, evaluate different alternatives, reduce the costs and identify the system obstacles. System dynamics is a computer-based approach for analyzing and designing complex systems over time. In this study the cognitive casualty map was developed to make a concept about the system then the stock-flow model was set up based on the market demand and supply concept. Results: The model demonstrates the interdependencies between the NDP variables through four cognitive maps. Some issues in availability, willingness to pay, rational use and quality of medicines are pointed in the model. The stock-flow diagram shows how the demand for a medicine is formed and how it is responded through NDP objectives. The effects of changing variables on the other NDP variables can be studied after running the stock-flow model. Conclusion: The model can initiate a fundamental structure for analyzing NDP. The conceptual model made a cognitive map to show many causes' and effects' trees and reveals some relations between NDP variables that are usually forgotten in the medicines affairs. The model also provides an opportunity to be expanded with more details on a specific disease for better policy making about medication.","[Abdollahiasl, Akbar; Kebriaeezadeh, Abbas; Jaberidoost, Mona; Nikfar, Shekoufeh] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Dept Pharmacoecon & Pharmaceut Adm, Pharmaceut Policy Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Abdollahiasl, Akbar; Kebriaeezadeh, Abbas; Jaberidoost, Mona; Nikfar, Shekoufeh] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Fac Pharm, Tehran, Iran; [Kebriaeezadeh, Abbas; Abdollahi, Mohammad] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Fac Pharm & Pharmaceut, Dept Toxicol & Pharmacol, Tehran, Iran; [Kebriaeezadeh, Abbas; Abdollahi, Mohammad] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Ctr Sci Res, Tehran, Iran; [Dinarvand, Rassoul] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Tehran, Iran; [Cheraghali, Abdol Majid] Minist Hlth & Med Educ, Food & Drug Org, Tehran, Iran; [Cheraghali, Abdol Majid] Univ Baqiyatallah Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Tehran, Iran","Abdollahiasl, A (reprint author), Tehran Univ Med Sci, Dept Pharmacoecon & Pharmaceut Adm, Pharmaceut Policy Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",abdollahiasl@gmail.com; kebriaee@sina.tums.ac.ir,"Abdollahi, Mohammad/B-9232-2008","Abdollahi, Mohammad/0000-0003-0123-1209",,,"Abdollahiasl A, 2011, ARCH MED SCI, V7, P365, DOI 10.5114/aoms.2011.23397; Abdollahiasl A, 2011, ARCH MED SCI, V7, P744, DOI 10.5114/aoms.2011.25546; Albin S, 2001, BUILDING SYSTEM DY 1; Merrill JA, 2013, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V20, pE131, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001289; Kruk ME, 2008, HEALTH POLICY, V85, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.09.003; Pfaffenbichler P, 2011, TRANSPORT REV, V31, P267, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2010.534570; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; Barlas Y, 1996, SYST DYNAM REV, V12, P183, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199623)12:3<183::AID-SDR103>3.0.CO;2-4; Brailsford S, 2001, GLASG SCOTL P ORAHS, P18; EDEN C, 1994, SYST DYNAM REV, V10, P257, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260100212; Forrester J.

Previous integrated modeling of transport scenarios has assumed active transport mode share and has been unable to incorporate acknowledged system feedbacks. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of policies to increase bicycle commuting in a car-dominated city and explored the role of participatory modeling to support transport planning in the face of complexity. METHODS: We used system dynamics modeling (SDM) to compare realistic policies, incorporating feedback effects, nonlinear relationships, and time delays between variables. We developed a system dynamics model of commuter bicycling through interviews and workshops with policy, community, and academic stakeholders. We incorporated best available evidence to simulate five policy scenarios over the next 40 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Injury, physical activity, fuel costs, air pollution, and carbon emissions outcomes were simulated. RESULTS: Using the simulation model, we demonstrated the kinds of policies that would likely be needed to change a historical pattern of decline in cycling into a pattern of growth that would meet policy goals. Our model projections suggest that transforming urban roads over the next 40 years, using best practice physical separation on main roads and bicycle-friendly speed reduction on local streets, would yield benefits 10-25 times greater than costs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first integrated simulation model of future specific bicycling policies. Our projections provide practical evidence that may be used by health and transport policy makers to optimize the benefits of transport bicycling while minimizing negative consequences in a cost-effective manner. The modeling process enhanced understanding by a range of stakeholders of cycling as a complex system. Participatory SDM can be a helpful method for integrating health and environmental outcomes in transport and urban planning.","[Macmillan, Alexandra; Woodward, Alistair] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Connor, Jennie] Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Dunedin 9056, New Zealand; [Witten, Karen] Massey Univ, SHORE, Auckland, New Zealand; [Kearns, Robin] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Rees, David] Synergia Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand","Macmillan, A (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, POB 56, Dunedin 9056, New Zealand.",alex.macmillan@otago.ac.nz,,,Health Research Council of New Zealand; NZ Transport Agency; NZ Ministry of Health,"This research was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.

The systems approach refers to analysing problems from the macroscopic perspective using systems thinking, and it has become an important method in the modern world. Many countries in Asia are newly industrialized, and systems engineering has played an important role. Although the systems approach is important, it seems that its application in social science field is still not so popular. This study used the evolution of system dynamics and industrial development research by systems thinking in Taiwan as an example to explore the phenomenon, in order to find the difficulty and future trend of the systems approach.

Specifically, compressed sensing is concerned with the recovery of a sparse signal from a small number of projections onto random vectors. This paper discusses how systems thinking contributed to uncovering key concepts of compressed sensing and presents the development of an extension of compressed sensing to the sparse network reconstruction problem. The sparse network reconstruction problem is a reverse engineering problem of interest in a wide variety of fields, ranging from remote sensing to social networks.","[Madni, Azad M.] Univ So Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Madni, AM (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",azad.madni@usc.edu,,,,,"Andriluka M., 2008, P IEEE C COMP VIS PA, P1, DOI 10.1145/1355284.1355286; Donoho DL, 2006, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V52, P1289, DOI 10.1109/TIT.2006.871582; Haupt J, 2006, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V52, P4036, DOI 10.1109/TIT.2006.880031; Candes EJ, 2006, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V52, P489, DOI 10.1109/TIT.2005.862083; MALLAT SG, 1993, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V41, P3397, DOI 10.1109/78.258082; Candes EJ, 2008, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V25, P21, DOI 10.1109/MSP.2007.914731; Baraniuk RG, 2007, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V24, P118, DOI 10.1109/MSP.2007.4286571; Candes EJ, 2006, COMMUN PUR APPL MATH, V59, P1207, DOI 10.1002/cpa.20124; Donoho DL, 2006, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V52, P6, DOI 10.1109/TIT.2005.860430; Candes E., 2006, P INT C MATH, V3, P1433; Hayes B, 2009, AM SCI, V97, P276; Madni A.

The CRLB defines the best achievable precision of any estimator for a given data model; it is often used in the statistical signal processing community for feasibility studies and system design. Computing the CRLB requires inverting the Fisher information matrix (FIM), however, which is usually ill-conditioned (and often underdetermined) in the case of diffuse optical tomography (DOT). We regularized the FIM by assuming that the inhomogeneity to be imaged was a point target and assessed the ability of point-target CRLBs to predict system performance in a typical DOT setting in silico. Our reconstructions, obtained with a common iterative algebraic technique, revealed that these bounds are not good predictors of imaging performance across different system configurations, even in a relative sense. This study demonstrates that agreement between the trends predicted by the CRLBs and imaging performance obtained with reconstruction algorithms that rely on a different regularization approach cannot be assumed a priori. Moreover, it underscores the importance of taking into account the intended regularization method when attempting to optimize source-detector configurations.

Recent field studies on mongooses (Herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. The first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the Malagasy Eupleridae, also have been initiated. The literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25years ago. In this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. Our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. Based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of Herpestidae as solitary and nine as group-living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. There is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera Crossarchus, Helogale, Liberiictis, Mungos, and Suricata. Our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. In some group-living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. Infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. However, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. Thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co-breeding in the context of food competition. By linking these facts, we show that the socio-ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. We also conclude that due to their long bio-geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the Eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.","[Schneider, Tilman C.; Kappeler, Peter M.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kappeler, Peter M.] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Schneider, TC (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Kellnerweg 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",t.schneider@stud.uni-goettingen.de,,,German Research Foundation [DFG Ka 1082/23-1],We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for comments on a previous version of this manuscript and to Alison Cooper for her careful editing.

Central to this aim is the need to accurately model global carbon fluxes. Photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation by the terrestrial biosphere is the largest of these fluxes, and in many ESMs is represented by the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis. The maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco, commonly termed Vc,max, is a key parameter in the FvCB model. This study investigated the derivation of the values of Vc,max used to represent different plant functional types (PFTs) in ESMs. Four methods for estimating Vc,max were identified; (1) an empirical or (2) mechanistic relationship was used to relate Vc,max to leaf N content, (3) Vc,max was estimated using an approach based on the optimization of photosynthesis and respiration or (4) calibration of a user-defined Vc,max to obtain a target model output. Despite representing the same PFTs, the land model components of ESMs were parameterized with a wide range of values for Vc,max (-46 to +77 % of the PFT mean). In many cases, parameterization was based on limited data sets and poorly defined coefficients that were used to adjust model parameters and set PFT-specific values for Vc,max. Examination of the models that linked leaf N mechanistically to Vc,max identified potential changes to fixed parameters that collectively would decrease Vc,max by 31 % in C-3 plants and 11 % in C-4 plants. Plant trait data bases are now available that offer an excellent opportunity for models to update PFT-specific parameters used to estimate Vc,max. However, data for parameterizing some PFTs, particularly those in the Tropics and the Arctic are either highly variable or largely absent.","Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Environm Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Rogers, A (reprint author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Environm Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",arogers@bnl.gov,"Rogers, Alistair/E-1177-2011","Rogers, Alistair/0000-0001-9262-7430","Laboratory Directed Research and Development funds at Brookhaven National Laboratory; The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project; Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the Department of Energy, Office of Science; United States Department of Energy [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","The Author is grateful to Vivek Arora, Douglas Clark, Rosie Fischer, Jinjun Ji, David Kubien, Joe Melton, Jared Oyler, Steve Running, Khachik Sargsyan, Peter Thornton, and Weile Wang for sharing unpublished work, providing model parameters and useful discussion.

We describe farming system dynamics in HNVF of southern Portugal, between 2000-2002 and 2008-2010, encompassing a period of major policy transformations introduced by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union in 2003. We also assess how farming system dynamics was modulated by structural, biophysical and policy factors constraining agricultural options. Farming systems changed in about 40% of the farmed area during the period of study. Overall, there was a marked transition from arable systems to either specialized livestock or permanent crop systems, involving major declines in the traditional system of dry cereal rotations and sheep grazing. Transitions were influenced by farm size, soil quality and coverage by open oak woodlands, while there was little effect of agri-environment schemes and legal regulations specifically targeted to support the traditional farming system. Despite these changes, agricultural intensity remained essentially stable, though there was a marked decline in land-use heterogeneity with likely negative impacts on biodiversity. Observed changes agree with ex-ante impact assessments of the CAP reform in Iberian cereal steppes, which suggested that decoupling of payments from production could promote shifts from the traditional cereal-fallow-sheep system towards specialized livestock grazing systems. Effectively protecting HNFV may thus require a better integration of horizontal policies and agri-environment schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There is potential for agricultural management to become a major part of improved strategies for controlling runoff. Here, a Catchment Systems Engineering (CSE) approach has been explored to solve the above problem. CSE is an interventionist approach to altering the catchment scale runoff regime through the manipulation of hydrological flow pathways throughout the catchment. By targeting hydrological flow pathways at source, such as overland flow, field drain and ditch function, a significant component of the runoff generation can be managed in turn reducing soil nutrient losses. The Belford catchment (5.7 km(2)) is a catchment scale study for which a CSE approach has been used to tackle a number of environmental issues. A variety of Runoff Attenuation Features (RAFs) have been implemented throughout the catchment to address diffuse pollution and flooding issues. The RAFs include bunds disconnecting flow pathways, diversion structures in ditches to spill and store high flows, large wood debris structure within the channel, and riparian zone management. Here a framework for applying a CSE approach to the catchment is shown in a step by step guide to implementing mitigation measures in the Belford Burn catchment. The framework is based around engagement with catchment stakeholders and uses evidence arising from field science. Using the framework, the flooding issue has been addressed at the catchment scale by altering the runoff regime. Initial findings suggest that RAFs have functioned as designed to reduce/attenuate runoff locally. However, evidence suggested that some RAFs needed modification and new RAFs be created to address diffuse pollution issues during storm events. Initial findings from these modified RAFs are showing improvements in sediment trapping capacities and reductions in phosphorus, nitrate and suspended sediment losses during storm events.

As biological processes are often complex in nature, it is desirable to address this issue using a systematic approach. Here, we propose a simple methodology that first performs an enrichment test to find patterns in the values of globally profiled kinetic parameters with which a model can produce the required system dynamics; this is then followed by a statistical test to elucidate the association between individual parameters and different parts of the system's dynamics. Results: We demonstrate our methodology on a prototype biological system of perfect adaptation dynamics, namely the chemotaxis model for Escherichia coli. Our results agreed well with those derived from experimental data and theoretical studies in the literature. Using this model system, we showed that there are motifs in kinetic parameters and that these motifs are governed by constraints of the specified system dynamics. Conclusions: A systematic approach based on enrichment statistical tests has been developed to elucidate the relationships between model parameters and the roles they play in affecting system dynamics of a prototype biological network. The proposed approach is generally applicable and therefore can find wide use in systems biology modeling research.","[Chiang, Austin W.

We present a mathematical model, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), that governs cancer growth on a cell population level. In addition to a cancer cell population, the model includes a population of Natural Killer (NK) and CD8C T immune cells. Our goal is to understand the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection, in addition to exploring results of applying combination immune, vaccine and chemotherapy treatments. We characterize the ODE system dynamics by locating equilibrium points, determining stability properties, performing a bifurcation analysis, and identifying basins of attraction. These system characteristics are useful, not only for gaining a broad understanding of the specific system dynamics, but also for helping to guide the development of combination therapies. Additionally, a parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may respond positively to treatment. Numerical simulations of mixed chemo-immuno and vaccine therapy using both mouse and human parameters are presented. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge, are able to reproduce data from published studies. We illustrate situations for which neither chemotherapy nor immunotherapy alone are sufficient to control tumor growth, but in combination the therapies are able to eliminate the entire tumor.","[de Pillis, Lisette G.] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Radunskaya, Ami E.] Pomona Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","de Pillis, LG (reprint author), Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Math, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",depillis@hmc.edu; aradunskaya@pomona.edu,,,,,"Adam J.A., 1997, SURVEY MODELS TUMOR; Bellomo N, 2000, MATH COMPUT MODEL, V32, P413, DOI 10.1016/S0895-7177(00)00143-6; Machiels JPH, 2001, CANCER RES, V61, P3689; Pardoll DM, 1998, NAT MED, V4, P525, DOI 10.1038/nm0598supp-525; de Pillis LG, 2005, CANCER RES, V65, P7950, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0564; Donnelly J, 2003, NAT MED, V9, P1354, DOI 10.1038/nm1103-1354; Glas R, 2000, J EXP MED, V191, P129, DOI 10.1084/jem.191.1.129; Stewart THM, 1996, MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRE, V56, P74; De Pillis LG, 2003, MATH COMPUT MODEL, V37, P1221, DOI 10.1016/S0895-7177(03)00133-X; Kawarada Y, 2001, J IMMUNOL, V167, P5247; Rosenberg SA, 2004, NAT MED, V10, P909, DOI 10.1038/nm1100; Henderson D, 2003, INT SER OPER RES MAN, V57, P287, DOI 10.1007/0-306-48056-5_10; Kieper WC, 2001, J IMMUNOL, V166, P5515; Gatenby RA, 2003, MOL CANCER THER, V2, P919; Wheeler CJ, 2004, CLIN CANCER RES, V10, P5316, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0497; Melichar B, 2001, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V48, P1711; Farrar JD, 1999, J IMMUNOL, V162, P2842; KUZNETSOV VA, 1992, BIOFIZIKA+, V37, P1063; MEYSKENS FL, 1984, CANCER RES, V44, P271; Lanzavecchia A, 2000, SCIENCE, V290, P92, DOI 10.1126/science.290.5489.92; de Pillis LG, 2006, CONTEMP MATH, V410, P89; AKCAKAYA HR, 1995, ECOLOGY, V76, P995, DOI 10.2307/1939362; Diefenbach A, 2001, NATURE, V413, P165, DOI 10.1038/35093109; Dalgleish AG, 2002, ADV CANCER RES, V84, P231, DOI 10.1016/S0065-230X(02)84008-8; Jiang H, 2004, J CLIN INVEST, V114, P1198, DOI 10.1172/JCI200423411; Li J, 2005, CLIN CANCER RES, V11, P2195, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1984; Germain RN, 2004, NAT MED, V10, P1307, DOI 10.1038/nm1159; Muller M, 1998, CANCER RES, V58, P5439; COLDMAN AJ, 1986, B MATH BIOL, V48, P279, DOI 10.1007/BF02459682; Cooper MA, 2001, TRENDS IMMUNOL, V22, P633, DOI 10.1016/S1471-4906(01)02060-9; O'Byrne KJ, 2000, EUR J CANCER, V36, P151, DOI 10.1016/S0959-8049(99)00241-5; Blattman JN, 2004, SCIENCE, V305, P200, DOI 10.1126/science.1100369; Qu ZX, 2005, METHODS, V36, P84, DOI 10.1016/j.ymeth.2005.01.008; Couzin J, 2002, SCIENCE, V297, P1973; Kirschner D, 1998, J MATH BIOL, V37, P235, DOI 10.1007/s002850050127; Dudley ME, 2002, SCIENCE, V298, P850, DOI 10.1126/science.1076514; Morecki S, 1996, INT J CANCER, V65, P204; de Pillis LG, 2006, J THEOR BIOL, V238, P841, DOI 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.06.037; Gardner SN, 2000, CANCER RES, V60, P1417; de Pillis L, 2013, DISCRETE CONT DYN-B, V18, P915, DOI 10.3934/dcdsb.2013.18.915; Mustafa MM, 1998, J PEDIAT HEMATOL ONC, V20, P451, DOI 10.1097/00043426-199809000-00008; Bannock L., 2002, NUTRITION; Borrelli R., 1998, DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIO; Britton N.F., 2003, ESSENTIAL MATH BIOL; Calabresi P., 1993, MED ONCOLOGY BASIC P; de Pillis L., 2003, SOC BIOL THER 17 ANN; de Pillis L, 2013, FRONT ONCOL, V3, P1; de Pillis L., 2012, COMPUTATIONAL TOXICO, V929, P51; de Pillis L.

The linkage between HATS presents a major challenge to the mining industry globally. When the immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS and silicosis, it makes it easier for tuberculosis to infect the body. In addition, the silica dust which affects the lungs may also cause silicosis and tuberculosis. The objective of this paper is to posit a big data integrated framework to assist in the prevention and control of HATS in the mining industry. Literature was reviewed in order to build a conceptual framework. Although this study is not the first to apply big data in healthcare,to the researcher's knowledge, it is the first to apply big data in understanding the linkage between HATS in the mining industry. The literature review indicates only a few studies using big data in healthcare with no research found on big data and HATS. It therefore makes a contribution to existing body of literature on the control of HATS. The proposed big data framework has the potential of addressing the needs of predictive epidemiology which is important in forecasting and disease control in the mining industry. The paper therefore lays a foundation for the use of viable systems model and big data to address the challenges of HATS in the mining industry. As part of future work, the framework will be validated using sequential explanatory mixed methods case study approach in mining organizations.","Univ S Africa, Sch Comp, ZA-1710 Johannesburg, South Africa","Jokonya, O (reprint author), Univ S Africa, Sch Comp, Private Bag X6, ZA-1710 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jokonyao@hotmail.com,,,,,"Corbett EL, 2000, AIDS, V14, P2759, DOI 10.1097/00002030-200012010-00016; Toh S, 2013, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V24, P349, DOI 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31828ac65e; teWaterNaude JM, 2006, OCCUP ENVIRON MED, V63, P187, DOI 10.1136/oem.2004.018614; [Anonymous], 2012, HARVARD PUBLIC HLTH; Jackson MC, 2010, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V27, P133, DOI 10.1002/sres.1020; Corbett EL, 2006, LANCET, V367, P926, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68383-9; Reynolds M, 2010, SYSTEMS APPROACHES TO MANAGING CHANGE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-84882-809-4_1; Beer S., 1984, Journal of the Operational Research Society, V35, DOI 10.2307/2581927; Boonstra A, 2010, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-10-231; Creswell J.

We present graduate and undergraduate courses in management of engineering and technology, aimed at developing a capacity for engineering systems thinking (CEST) in students. The undergraduate course is based on executing projects in teams. The graduate course is based on systems engineering principles. At the start and at the end of the courses, CEST is evaluated by addressing and measuring four components: cognitive characteristics, abilities, personal traits, and knowledge. The data collected in the current study was used to analyze the four above-mentioned components of CEST. The study findings allow us to conclude that systems thinking can develop by participation in courses and other appropriate educational programs. Better understanding of the ways in which system thinking is developed can provide a better foundation for systems thinking educational programs.","[Koral-Kordova, Sigal; Frank, Moti] Holon Inst Technol, Management Technol Fac, Holon, Israel","Koral-Kordova, S (reprint author), Holon Inst Technol, Management Technol Fac, Holon, Israel.",,,,,,"Sweeney LB, 2000, SYST DYNAM REV, V16, P249, DOI 10.1002/sdr.198; Hung W, 2008, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V39, P1099, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00791.x; Ben Zvi Assaraf O., 2004, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P518; Crawford A.

Meanwhile, modern communication and information technologies have provided greater possibilities for socio-economic sectors to execute smarter decisions, and these technologies may advance the industrial application of SoSE. Therefore, targeting the rareness of government-oriented intelligent decision support system (DSS), and guided by the underlying system of systems thinking, this paper proposes a technical framework for designing a policy maker-responsive smart information system which focuses: (1) system of systems structural architecting; (2) geographical simulation using time-series remotely sensed data, GIS instrument and simulation bodies such as cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS); (3) SoS evolution description through network analysis and intelligent computing; (4) measurement of SoS effectiveness with two-tier and four-grade method; and (5) SoSE program for industrial optimization. Its application in tourism analysis will provide a smarter base for industrial policy-making, planning and forecasting, and will help reduce risk and cost in industrial restructuring. For this relatively new field of SoSE application, tools and methods are not perfect, so it is important to draw together academia, government, industrial organizations and enterprises to collaborate for further valuable achievement.","Guangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business Adm, Nanning 530003, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China","Bai, LM (reprint author), Guangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business Adm, 100 Mingxiu West Rd, Nanning 530003, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China.",putaoren2000@aliyun.com,,,,,"Barabasi AL, 1999, SCIENCE, V286, P509, DOI 10.1126/science.286.5439.509; Mane M, 2007, J AIRCRAFT, V44, P1222, DOI 10.2514/1.26333; Watts DJ, 1998, NATURE, V393, P440, DOI 10.1038/30918; Barabasi AL, 1999, PHYSICA A, V272, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4371(99)00291-5; Bian X.

According to the common thought of system coordination analysis and appraisal, it divides the large-scale system into a multi-level system which contains: oil-gas resourceful system, population system, economic system, technique system and environmental system. It analyzed the factor, correlative relationship, function and mechanism of sub-system. It applies the theory and method of system dynamics into the simulation research of oil-gas resource and social economy system coordinated development. According to the correlative relationship of the system, it constructs the SD (system dynamics) model of oil-gas resource and social economy system coordinated development, carries out validity and rationality checkout with data from 1999 to 2006, and finally simulates various developing schemes brought forward the petroleum industry and economy in the future, which can find out the most rational developing scheme in the future. The paper carries out the beneficial exploration of oil-gas resource and social economy system coordinated development. Nowadays, under the situation of sustainable social development, companies are faced with environment problem which has become an important issue in operation, so green ecotypic construction of oilfield plays an important role in the long-term development of oilfield and the whole regional economy. Sustainable coordinated development theory requires population, resources, environment and economic development maintain regular dynamic coordination in a region. Many foreign scholars have carried out research about the evaluation model of sustainable coordinated development. Using endogenous growth model, Young-Seok Moon studied the relation between energy consumption and economic growth, and emphasized the government's control. Konstantion Bithas and Peter Nijkamp put forward a modeling method for environmental-economic coordination model which used expert knowledge system under uncertain information conditions. There are many domestic scholars also have carried out many useful explorations in these research areas. WANG Yu-qi, HU Yun-quan and ZHAO Da-wei etc. carried out system analysis and simulation for sustainable development of the oil industry in virtue of SD, and made a series of valuable and leading research production. LIU Yan and WANG Yu-qi used system dynamics theory and took the characteristics of the oil industry into consideration, they explained the causal relationship of the sustainable development of oil industry, and construct the system dynamics model of sustainable development of oil industry. WANG Zhi-kun and ZHANG Zai-xu etc. studied the establishment and application of systematic dynamics model for petroleum exploration and development. BAI Hua and HAN Wen-xiu studied deeply on the coordination mechanism of the compound system of regional economy-resources-environment, and quantified the static and dynamic coordination degree of the compound system of regional economy-resources-environment, and then they proposed a static coordination management method which was based on the behavior matrix. ZENG Rong and WEI Yi-ming etc. utilized system theory to propose the concept that complex systems including population, resources, environment and economy develop harmonically, and illustrated the structure characteristics of the complex systems, internal coordination mechanism of each subsystem and the development of systems. System dynamics method is based on the control theory of sate-feedback, through establishing structured system model with causation and carrying out digital simulation with computer, it can synthetically study mechanism of the whole motion of system from two aspects including quality and quantity. In virtue of system dynamics method, through analyzing the mechanism of informational linkage and feedback, this paper considers the comprehensive coordination of all sorts of factors and how to promote the sustainable coordinated development of oil field systems' ecology, accordingly, proposes theoretical guidance for formulating the strategy of sustainable development of China's economy and oil industry.","China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China","Yan, S (reprint author), China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",sunyancup@126.com,,,,,"Moon YS, 1996, RESOUR ENERGY ECON, V18, P189, DOI 10.1016/0928-7655(96)00006-1; Nijkamp P, 1997, EUR J OPER RES, V99, P180, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(96)00391-8; Bai Hua, 1999, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, p[19, 71]; Bithas Konstantions, 1996, ENV SYSTEM, V25, P167; LI Song, 2003, J JILIN U ENG TECHNO, P102; LIU Yan, 2006, JOURNAL OF HARBIN UN, P79; WANG Zhikun, 2001, J U PETROLEUM CHINA, P125; ZENG Rong, 2000, SYSTEMS ENG THEORY P, P1; Zhang ZQ, 2002, ISOTOPIC CHRONOLOGY, P1",9,0,0,3,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-174-4,,,,2014,,,,,,,1124,1131,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Management",Business & Economics,BC2LK,WOS:000351057000155,S,"Hazra, L",,"Costa, MFPCM; Zghal, M",,"Hazra, Lakshminarayan",,,A Course on Foundations of Optical System Analysis and Design (FOSAD),12TH EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS CONFERENCE,Proceedings of SPIE,,English,Proceedings Paper,12th Education and Training in Optics and Photonics Conference,"JUL 23-26, 2013","Porto, PORTUGAL","Int Commiss Opt, IEEE Photon Soc, Opt Soc, SPIE",,Lens Design; Optical System Analysis; Optical System Design; Teaching of Optics,TEACHING LENS DESIGN,"Optical system analysis and design constitute one of the core activities in optical engineering.

Applied to the Canadian context and with body mass index as the primary outcome, we examine policy portfolios for obesity prevention, including (1) industry self-regulation efforts, (2) health-and nutrition-sensitive governmental policy, and (3) efforts to foster health-and nutrition-sensitive innovation. This work provides novel theoretical and practical insights on drivers of nutritional market transformations, highlighting the importance of integrative policy portfolios to simultaneously shift food demand and supply for successful and self-sustaining nutrition and health sensitivity. We discuss model extensions for deeper and more comprehensive linkages of nutritional food market transformation with supply, demand, and policy in agrifood and health/health care. These aim toward system design and policy that can proactively, and with greater impact, scale, and resilience, address single as well as double malnutrition in varying country settings.","[Struben, Jeroen;

However, the growth of cloud computing also goes hand in hand with an increasing demand for energy, caused by a continuously growing demand for content, data-intensive applications and bandwidth. The debates on the energy implications of the substantial shift to cloud computing among industry experts, researchers and civil society organizations mainly focus on stand-alone aspects of this shift, whereas a comprehensive view on the whole system, its inter-relations and driving forces are still rare. In the course of an EU-funded project (www.SCP-RESPONDER.eu) the syntax of causal loop diagrams and analytical tools of system dynamics has been used to develop a system map of the diverse effect pathways that a shift to cloud computing may have on energy consumption. The map was developed in an iterative participatory expert consultation process involving 25 experts from industry, research and policy-making. The map allows for integrating different strands of knowledge, shedding light on the dynamics of the whole system and identifying leverage points for business strategies as well as policy interventions. It shows that the effects on overall energy consumption depend on (1) relative strengths of the individual effect pathways which are, inter alia, (2) dependent on energy efficiency gains achieved through a broad diversity of measures in very different areas, while (3) the key drivers of the whole system are economy of scales (through reductions of service cost per unit) and (4) new user needs for data-intensive services. While some experts perceive these dynamics as typical rebound effects (increased efficiency is compensated by growth), others regard them as success strategies for individual businesses and the sector as a whole. Both groups share the view that service reliability, privacy and security of cloud services are the most important leverage points of the whole system. Furthermore, even if, through the growth of data-intensive services, the shift to cloud computing would cause growth of the overall energy consumption, this increase might potentially be off-set by third-order effects in the form of savings in the areas of mobility or housing (e.g. teleworking).","[Sedlacko, Michal; Martinuzzi, Andre] WU Vienna, Inst Managing Sustainabil, Vienna, Austria","Sedlacko, M (reprint author), WU Vienna, Inst Managing Sustainabil, Vienna, Austria.",andre.martinuzzi@wu.ac.at; karin.dobernig@wu.ac.at,,,,,"Accenture, 2010, CLOUD COMP SUST ENV; Moberg A, 2010, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V30, P177, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2009.07.001; Videira N, 2009, ECOL ECON, V68, P965, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.11.008; Bianchini R, 2004, COMPUTER, V37, P68, DOI 10.1109/MC.2004.217; Edwards JB, 2010, INT J PHYS DISTR LOG, V40, P103, DOI 10.1108/09600031011018055; Weber CL, 2010, J IND ECOL, V14, P754, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00269.x; Baliga J., 2010, P IEEE, V99, P149; BITKOM, 2008, CLOUD COMP WAS ENTSC; Borderstep Institut fur Innovation und Nachhaltigkeit, 2012, GUT ZUM THEM GREEN I; Casal C.

This exploration requires both: topological changes in the potential system architecture and consistent parametrical changes in the dimensioning of the existing system components. Since advanced engineering design techniques nowadays advocate a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach, graph-based design languages which embed a superset of MBSE-features are consequently used in this work to systematically explore the feasible design space. Design languages allow the design knowledge to be represented, modeled and executed using model-based transformations and combine this among other features with constraint processing techniques. The execution of the design language shown for the satellite propulsion systems in this work yields topologically varied designs (i.e. the selection of a monergol, a diergol or a coldgas system) with consistent parameters. Based on an a posteriori performance analysis of the automatically generated system designs, novel system knowledge (most notably in form of so-called ""topology change points"") can be gained and extracted from the original point cloud of numerical results.",,,schmidt@isd.uni-stuttgart.de; rudolph@isd.uni-stratgart.de,,,,,"RITTEL HWJ, 1973, POLICY SCI, V4, P155, DOI 10.1007/BF01405730; Rudolph S, 2004, AEROSP SCI TECHNOL, V8, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.ast.2004.03.001; Gross J., 2014, THESIS U STUTTGART; IILS mbH, 2005, DES COMP 43; Pahl G., 2005, KONSTRUKTIONSLEHRE; Thunnissen D., 2003, 39 AIAA ASME SAE ASE; Wertz J.

As such, using combined social and environmental perspectives to understand how people and wildlife are interlinked, together with the mechanisms that may weaken or strengthen those linkages, is of utmost importance. However, such integrated information is lacking. To help fill this information gap, we describe an integrated coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach for analyzing the patterns, causes, and consequences of changes in wildlife population and habitat, human population and land use, and their interactions. Using this approach, we synthesize research in two sites, Wolong Nature Reserve in China and Chitwan National Park in Nepal, to explicate key relationships between people and two globally endangered wildlife conservation icons, the giant panda and the Bengal tiger. This synthesis reveals that local resident characteristics such as household socioeconomics and demography, as well as community-level attributes such as resource management organizations, affect wildlife and their habitats in complex and even countervailing ways. Human impacts on wildlife and their habitats are in turn modifying the suite of ecosystem services that they provide to local residents in both sites, including access to forest products and cultural values. These interactions are further complicated by human and natural disturbance (e. g., civil wars, earthquakes), feedbacks (including policies), and telecouplings (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) that increasingly link the focal systems with other distant systems. We highlight several important implications of using a CHANS approach for wildlife research and conservation that is useful not only in China and Nepal but in many other places around the world facing similar challenges.","[Carter, Neil H.] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, London, England; [Vina, Andres; Hull, Vanessa; McConnell, William J.; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Axinn, William; Ghimire, Dirgha] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Carter, NH (reprint author), Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, London, England.",,"Liu, Jianguo/G-5211-2015; ","Liu, Jianguo/0000-0001-6344-0087; Carter, Neil/0000-0002-4399-6384",United States Fish and Wildlife Service Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund; National Science Foundation; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"We thank the International Trust for Nature Conservation (UK), Tiger Tops Jungle Lodge, the Institute for Social and Environmental Research-Nepal, Wolong Nature Reserve, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences for their contributions to the research underlying this paper, as well as the Nepal Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, the State Forestry Administration, and the Sichuan Forestry Department for permission to collect data inside Chitwan National Park and Wolong Nature Reserve.

The authors suggest that the engineering-driven approach to the field's challenges may have been necessary in the beginning but should be complemented by looking into implications from the social sciences. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness for the field of (social) system theory by taking two steps back: One to revisit the foundational concepts of AugCog from an alternative perspective, another to illustrate the relevance and importance of social systems principles to the AugCog field. We outline practical implications that (social) system theory holds for the design of adaptation management and conclude our review by suggesting that an approach to human-system cooperation may be able to address the challenges.","[Fuchs, Sven; Schwarz, Jessica; Flemisch, Frank O.] Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany","Fuchs, S (reprint author), Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany.",sven.fuchs@fkie.fraunhofer.de; jessica.schwarz@fkie.fraunhofer.de; frank.flemisch@fkie.fraunhofer.de,,,,,"Dong YC, 2011, IEEE T INTELL TRANSP, V12, P596, DOI 10.1109/TITS.2010.2092770; ENDSLEY MR, 1995, HUM FACTORS, V37, P381, DOI 10.1518/001872095779064555; Arciszewski HFR, 2009, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V39, P1188, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2026428; Feigh KM, 2012, HUM FACTORS, V54, P1008, DOI 10.1177/0018720812443983; Sciarini LW, 2009, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V5638, P533, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-02812-0_62; Ashby WR, 1958, CYBERNETICA, V1, P83; BANKS SB, 1991, IEEE EXPERT, V6, P18, DOI 10.1109/64.87681; Belyavin A., 2005, P 11 INT C HUM COMP; Bertalanffy L.

Our objective was to test the effects of changes in gene transcription in adipose tissue on patterns of metabolism, reproductive processes and efficiency. The model describes the substrate sensitivity and maximum velocity for lipogenesis, esterification and lipolysis. Data were collected from first and second parity cows from various studies, and included nutrient intake, milk component output, changes in adipose tissue lipid, visceral and body protein and lipid, and metabolism rates in adipose tissue and gene transcription. The lipogenic pathways were primarily controlled by transcriptional changes, whereas lipolysis varied primarily by post-translational control. We used the difference in transcriptional and post-translational metabolic control to alter V-max and K-s for lipogenesis and lipolysis; in addition, we modelled a range of energy costs for ion transport and protein turnover in liver, muscle and adipose tissues. Changing rates of lipogenesis and lipolysis (similar to four-fold) did not affect milk production or feed intake, but altered maintenance costs, fat accretion, energetic efficiency and reproduction. Increases in lipogenesis decreased postpartum interval to first ovulation; increases in rates of lipolysis increased the interval. Changes in metabolic rate from changing either adipose tissue metabolism or rate of ion transport and protein turnover affected rates of oestrogen and progesterone degradation, which affected follicular growth and corpus luteum function. This model may be used to help interpret genomic and transcriptomic data to pinpoint the most effective ways to select and manage for changes in productive and reproductive efficiency.","[Huber, K.; Kenez, A.] Univ Vet Med, Dept Physiol, D-30173 Hannover, Germany; [McNamara, J.

The system-intergrated cybernetic environment (cyberspace) can be fully used in present-day processes, namely in the dynamically evolving modern electronic business. The key to new ways of system integration in the business cyberspace will be most of all the ability to perfect the environment of system integration, namely with the goal of achieving modern control in a hierarchically ordered cyberspace, for instance e-business with information. The ultimate aim of this article is to review the current trends in modern modelling and simulation methods for the design of a system-integrated e-business model, namely considering the already verified cybernetic applications in practice and the use of selected cybernetic, artificial intelligence and mathematical modelling for a new design of intelligent business models featuring optimal structures and adaptable behaviour. The article is based on the solution of certain specific research tasks carried out at the university, with emphasis on the fact that new economy will increasingly rely on information, knowledge and system-defined modern control environment represented in particular by the use of system engineering theory and creation of cybernetic and system-theory applications for the development of future intelligent e-business models integrated and integrable with information, data, knowledge and visions. Competition will always be understood in the global sense and gradually defined by intelligent means obtained by the system solution of models, modelling and simulation, particularly those of the complicated hierarchical structures of electronic business with the state functions required for control, namely in the system integration cyberspace in the area of cybernetic applications.","[Jankova, Martina; Dvorak, Jiri] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Informat, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",,jankova@fbm.vutbr.cz; dvorakj@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,"Barvir M., 2005, KYBERNETIKA SPOLECNO; Basl J., 2010, PODNIKOVE INFORM SYS; David J., 2006, FEEDBACK CONTROL DYN; Dostal P., 2005, POKROCILE METODY MAN; Dvorak J., 2013, SYSTEMOVE INZENYRSTV; Dvorak J., 2010, E COMMERCE ITS IMPAC, P397; Grady J., 2012, SYSTEM INTEGRATION S; Hubalovsky S., 2011, TEORIE SYSTEMU MODEL; Jankova M., 2013, MOZNOSTI SYSTEMOVE I; Kremen J., 2007, MODELY SYSTEMY; Krupka J., 2008, ZAKLADY TECHNICKEJ K; Krupka J., 2009, ABECEDA TVORBY MODEL; Laudon K.

Healthcare systems are complex and currently facing several challenges. The following chapter serves to explore the application of a system of systems approach to healthcare, i.e., a healthcare system of systems (HSoS). Specifically, a HSoS is defined as a collection of independent, large-scale complex, distributed systems.

Malaysia relies heavily on fossil fuels for electricity generation. To diversify the fuel-mix, a technology-specific target has been set by the government in 2010. Considering the complexity in generation expansion, there is a dire need for an assessment model that can evaluate policy in a feedback fashion. The study also aims to expand policy evaluation literature in electricity domain by taking a dynamic systems approach. Design/methodology/approach - System dynamics modelling and simulation approach is used in this study. The model variables, selected from literature, are constituted into casual loop diagram. Later, a stock and flow diagram is developed by integrating planning, construction, operation, and decision making sub-models. The dynamic interactions between the sub-sectors are analysed based on the short-, medium- and long-term policy targets. Findings - Annual capacity constructions fail to achieve short-, medium- and long-term targets. However, the difference in operational capacity and medium- and long-term target are small. In terms of technology, solar photovoltaic (PV) attains the highest level of capacity followed by biomass. Research limitations/implications - While financial calculations are crucial for capacity expansion decisions, currently they are not being modelled; this study primarily focuses on system delays and exogenous components only.

Patients and Methods: A model of erythropoiesis and its response to ESAs on the basis of a BMSD method (Mayo Clinic Anemia Management System [MCAMS]) was developed. Thereafter, an open-label, prospective, nonrandomized practice quality improvement project was performed with retrospective analysis in 8 community-based outpatient hemodialysis facilities. All prevalent hemodialysis patients seen from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2010 (300-342 patients per month), were included with darbepoetin as the ESA. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who attained the desired hemoglobin level. Secondary outcome measures included the percentage of patients with hemoglobin values above the desired range and mean dose of darbepoetin used. Results: The 3 treatment periods were (1) standard ESA protocol in 2007, (2) transition to the MCAMS (2008 to June 2009), and (3) stability period with the MCAMS used in all hemodialysis facilities (2009 to 2010). In the first 6 months of 2007, 69% of patients were in the desired range and 26% were above the range. In comparison, during the first 5 months of 2010, 83% were in and 6% were above the range (P<.001). The mean monthly darbepoetin dose per patient decreased from 304 mg in 2007 to 173 mg by the second half of 2009 (P<.001). Conclusion: With the introduction of the MCAMS, more patients had hemoglobin levels in the desired range and fewer patients exceeded the target range, with a concomitant 40% reduction in darbepoetin use.

Therefore, understanding contest behaviour can help to elucidate the trade-offs of living in differing social systems and shed light on the evolution of social behaviour. In the current study, we compared contest behaviour in two closely related species of Lamprologine cichlid fish. Neolamprologus pulcher and Telmatochromis temporalis are both pair-breeding cichlids, but N. pulcher are highly social, group-living fish, while T temporalis display no grouping behaviour. To examine how competition varies by species, sex and familiarity, we staged same-sex conspecific contests over a shelter, a resource that is highly valued by both species, where contestants were either familiar or unfamiliar to one another. When we examined tactical and strategic components of these contests, we found that the highly social species had shorter contests and engaged in fewer costly aggressive acts than did the non-social species. Individuals of the highly social species were also more likely to resolve conflicts through the use of submissive displays, while individuals of the non-social species were more likely to flee from conflict. Familiarity increased the use of submissive displays in the highly social species but not in the less social species. Our findings suggest that conflict resolution behaviour and dominance hierarchy formation are fundamentally linked to the evolution of complex social systems.","[Hick, Kristina] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Reddon, Adam R.; O'Connor, Constance M.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada","O'Connor, CM (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",coconn@mcmaster.ca,,,NSERC; Margo Wilson and Martin Daly Ontario Graduate Scholarship; E.B.

However, the most common behaviours are not stereotyped, and these are usually seen as inappropriate or more difficult to analyze in a phylogenetic context. A few methods have been proposed to deal with such data, although they have never been tested on samples larger than six species, which limits their evolutionary interest. In the present study, we perform behavioural observations on 13 cockroach species and derive behavioural phylogenetic characters with the successive event-pairing method. We combine these characters with morphological and molecular data (approximately 6800 bp) in a phylogenetic study of 41 species. We then reconstruct ancestral states of the behavioural data to study evolution of social behaviour in these insects with regard to their social systems (i.e. solitary, gregarious, and subsocial) and diversity of habitat choice. We report for the first time that nonstereotyped behavioural data are adequate for phylogenetic analyses: they are no more homoplastic than traditional data, and support several phylogenetic relationships that we discuss. From an evolutionary perspective, we show that the solitary species Thanatophyllum akinetum does not display original behavioural interactions, suggesting phylogenetic inertia of interactive behaviours despite a radical change in social structure. Conversely, the subsocial species Parasphaeria boleiriana shows original behavioural interactions, which could result from its peculiar social system or habitat. We conclude that phylogenetic approaches in studies of behaviour are useful for deciphering evolution of behaviour and discriminating between its different modalities, even for nonstereotyped characters.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 58-77.","[Legendre, Frederic; D'Haese, Cyrille A.; Pellens, Roseli; Grandcolas, Philippe] CNRS, UMR 7205, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, F-75005 Paris, France; [Deleporte, Pierre] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Biol Stn, UMR 6552, F-35380 Paimpont, France; [Whiting, Michael F.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Schliep, Klaus] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut,UMR 7138, F-75005 Paris, France","Legendre, F (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 7205, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, CP 50,45 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",legendre@mnhn.fr,"Legendre, Frederic/B-5101-2013; D'HAESE, Cyrille/D-4896-2012","Legendre, Frederic/0000-0001-5900-8048; D'HAESE, Cyrille/0000-0001-6065-0927","French Ministere de la Recherche; Programme Pluri-Formation (PPF) ""Etat et structure phylogenetique de la biodiversite actuelle et fossile'; NSF [DEB-0120718]","This study was developed during the course of a PhD granted by French Ministere de la Recherche to FL. Molecular work was carried out partly in Michael Whiting's laboratory (Brigham Young University, Provo) and partly in Ward Wheeler's laboratory (American Museum of Natural History, New York). It was supported by the Programme Pluri-Formation (PPF) ""Etat et structure phylogenetique de la biodiversite actuelle et fossile' directed by Philippe Janvier (FL), by NSF DEB-0120718 (MFW) and by a NASA postdoctoral fellowship through the AMNH (CAD). The foregoing PPF also supported a field trip to French Guiana where FL and PG collected living specimens. Most of the phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the resources of the Computational Biology Service Unit from the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN, Paris), which was partially funded by Saint Gobain. We thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. We also thank Herve Amat and Station Biologique de Paimpont for providing help and facilities for behavioural observations, as well as Odette Morvan and Jean Cerda for their assistance in French Guiana.

This approach is inspired by the conceptual model-based systems biology paradigm we have previously proposed. The notion of presence and absence of surrounding objects, or occurrence of surrounding processes, is becoming ever more critical in a world of highly-aware automation agents and the increasingly complex and stochastic environmental configurations in which these agents act. This problem is well-known in the biological modeling domain. System models usually focus on nominal, mainstream aspects and scenarios. Presence-related aspects are often assumed to pose no issue, and remain unattended in both the conceptual and actual system design phases. The Pareto rule-of thumb of system design asserts that about 20% of design and development efforts cover the nominal, ""sunny day"" process, while the other 80% cover exceptions, alternative scenarios, failure modes, edge conditions, special settings, and emergencies. We propose an approach to extend the naive, nominal system model by enriching it with notions of presence -awareness and sensitivity. This approach is facilitated by Object-Process Methodology, a holistic system and process modeling framework, currently being adopted as ISO standard 19450.","[Mordecai, Yaniv; Somekh, Judith; Dori, Dov] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Dori, Dov] MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Mordecai, Y (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",vanivmor@technion.ac.il; ysomekh@gmail.com; dori@mit.edu,,,,,"Lee KM, 2004, COMMUN THEOR, V14, P27, DOI 10.1093/ct/14.1.27; Dori D, 2011, HANDBOOK OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING: THEORY, PRACTICE AND RESEARCH CHALLENGES, P209; Peleg M, 2009, J BIOMED INFORM, V42, P736, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2009.05.003; Kitano H, 2004, NAT REV GENET, V5, P826, DOI 10.1038/nrg1471; Christein H., 2002, GEN PURPOSE MODEL PR; Dori D., 2003, DEV COMPLEX SYSTEMS, P570; Dori D, 2002, OBJECT PROCESS METHO; Dori D., 2010, 1 INT C MOD MAN ENG, P1; Dori D, 2007, PLOS ONE, V2, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0000872; Estefan J., 2007, SURVEY MODEL BASED S; Haimes Y.-Y., 2009, RISK MODELING ASSESS; Hughes R., 2005, JANES DEFENSE WEEKLY, P1; Mordecai Y., 2014, IEEE INT C SOFTW SCI; Mordecai Y., 2013, IEEE INT C SYST MAN; Mordecai Yaniv, 2013, International Journal of Strategic Engineering Asset Management, V1, DOI 10.1504/IJSEAM.2013.060467; Pedersen E., 1997, P ACM SIGCHI C, P1; Scott B.

The SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) model of work system and patient safety is a human factors systems approach that has been successfully applied in healthcare research and practice. Several research and practical applications of the SEIPS model are described. Important implications of the SEIPS model for healthcare system and process redesign are highlighted. Principles for redesigning healthcare systems using the SEIPS model are described. Balancing the work system and encouraging the active and adaptive role of workers are key principles for improving healthcare quality and patient safety.

While this discussion was at first mainly focused on a society level - and sometimes regarding especially environmental problems, one can now see that this topic is of increasing relevance for companies worldwide and even the social dimension of this three pillar approach is gaining more and more importance. This leads to some questions: Is sustainability already a part of human factors thinking or do we have to further develop our discipline? How can we define sustainable work systems? What are the topics we have to consider? Do we need a new systems ergonomics perspective regarding whole value creation chains and a life-cycle perspective concerning products (and work systems)?

The suggested approach is based on the combination of ideas employed in the theory of biological populations, system theory, and utility theory. The evolution equations are defined as utility rate equations, whose parameters are characterized by the utility of each group with respect to the society as a whole and by the mutual utilities of groups with respect to each other. We analyze in detail the cases of two groups (cooperators and defectors) and of three groups (cooperators, defectors, and regulators) and find that, in a self-organized society, neither defectors nor regulators can overpass the maximal fractions of about 10% each. This is in agreement with the data for bee and ant colonies. The classification of societies by their distance from equilibrium is proposed. We apply the formalism to rank the countries according to the introduced metric quantifying their relative stability, which depends on the cost of defectors and regulators as well as their respective population fractions. We find a remarkable concordance with more standard economic ranking based, for instance, on GDP per capita.","[Yukalov, Vyacheslav I.; Yukalova, Elizaveta P.; Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Yukalov, Vyacheslav I.] Joint Inst Nucl Res, Bogolubov Lab Theoret Phys, Dubna, Russia; [Yukalova, Elizaveta P.] Joint Inst Nucl Res, Informat Technol Lab, Dubna, Russia; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland","Yukalov, VI (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",yukalov@theor.jinr.ru,,,"ETH Zurich Competence Center ""Coping with Crises in Complex Socio-Economic Systems""","Partial financial support from the ETH Zurich Competence Center ""Coping with Crises in Complex Socio-Economic Systems"" is acknowledged.

A systematic analysis based on theoretical considerations, policy analysis and experts' knowledge is followed in order to define the concept of ESD. The principles underlying ESD feed the development of a System Dynamics Model (SDM) that connects the pollutant loads produced by urban systems' socioeconomic activities with the ecological condition of the coastal ecosystem that it is delineated in operational terms through key biological elements defined by the EU Water Framework Directive. The receiving waters of the Athens Metropolitan area, which bears the elements of typical high population density Mediterranean coastal city but which currently has also new dynamics induced by the ongoing financial crisis, are used as an experimental system for testing a system dynamics approach to apply the concept of ESD. Systems' thinking is employed to represent the complex relationships among the components of the system. Interconnections and dependencies that determine the potentials for achieving ESD are revealed. The proposed system dynamics analysis can facilitate decision makers to define paths of development that comply with the principles of ESD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

SD emphasizes state-dependent feedback interaction to describe the emergent properties of a complex system. These mechanisms maintain biological systems with homeostatic limits on a temporal basis. Previous empirical studies on CAM have correlated biological constants (e. g. enzyme kinetic parameters) with expression over the CAM diel cycle. The SD model integrates these constants within the architecture of the CAM 'system'. This allowed quantitative causal connections to be established between biological inputs and the four distinct phases of CAM delineated by gas exchange and malic acid accumulation traits. Regulation at flow junctions (e. g. stomatal and mesophyll conductance, and malic acid transport across the tonoplast) that are subject to feedback control (e. g. stomatal aperture, malic acid inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and enzyme kinetics) was simulated. Simulated expression for the leaf-succulent Kalanchoe daigremontiana and more succulent tissues of Agave tequilana showed strong correlation with measured gas exchange and malic acid accumulation (R-2 = 0.912 and 0.937, respectively, for K. daigremontiana and R-2 = 0.928 and 0.942, respectively, for A. tequilana). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantitatively identify determinants of diel CO2 uptake. The transition in CAM expression from low to high volume/area tissues (elimination of phase II-IV carbon-uptake signatures) was achieved largely by the manipulation three input parameters.","[Owen, Nick A.; Griffiths, Howard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England","Owen, NA (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",nafowen@gmail.com,,,Australian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC),Research was funded by the Australian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC).

Based on a systems thinking philosophy, the paper aims to adopt an Object-Oriented (OO) approach based on the concepts of System Dynamics (SD) such as stocks and flows to analyze the dynamics in a hydrological system in a watershed scale. Object-Oriented modeling is a way to organize data into discrete, recognizable entities called objects. These objects could be concrete (such as a river reach) or conceptual (such as a policy decision). In the present paper, VENSIM PLE has been used for the modeling purpose. The application was illustrated in an Iranian watershed. The model was examined using validity and verifying tests. The results showed that the model is capable of generating the monthly runoff quite well. The values of R-2 are 0.69 and 0.61 for generated discharge values at Polchehr and Doab stations respectively. Also the values of NSE are 0.66 and 0.64 for estimated discharge values at the same stations. The capability of model was more clarified comparing R-2 and NSE coefficients obtained by a SWAT model with those obtained by Watershed Hydrological Model developed in this study.","[Ghashghaei, Maryam; Bagheri, Ali; Morid, Saeed] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Tehran, Iran","Bagheri, A (reprint author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 14115-139, Tehran, Iran.",ali.bagheri@modares.ac.ir; morid_sa@modares.ac.ir,,,,,"ABBOTT MB, 1986, J HYDROL, V87, P61, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(86)90115-0; ABBOTT MB, 1986, J HYDROL, V87, P45, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(86)90114-9; Aboelata M, 1998, THESIS U MANITOBA CA; Ahmad S, 2000, J COMPUT CIVIL ENG, V14, P190, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2000)14:3(190); Ahmad S, 2006, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V20, P391, DOI 10.1007/s11269-006-0326-3; Agarwal A, 2004, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V18, P285, DOI 10.1023/B:WARM.0000043134.76163.b9; Thanapakpawin P, 2007, J HYDROL, V334, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.10.012; Martinez CJ, 2008, J HYDROL, V351, P368, DOI 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.01.002; Ahmad S, 2004, J COMPUT CIVIL ENG, V18, P331, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2004)18:4(331); Gastelum JR, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P1285, DOI 10.1007/s11269-009-9497-z; Feng LH, 2008, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V22, P621, DOI 10.1007/s11269-007-9182-z; Deckers DLEH, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P3961, DOI 10.1007/s11269-010-9642-8; Winz I, 2009, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V23, P1301, DOI 10.1007/s11269-008-9328-7; Ahmad S, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P3371, DOI 10.1007/s11269-010-9611-2; Todini E, 1996, J HYDROL, V175, P339, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(96)80016-3; Nasiri F, 2013, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V27, P675, DOI 10.1007/s00477-012-0631-8; Hassanzadeh E, 2012, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V26, P129, DOI 10.1007/s11269-011-9909-8; Al-Abed N, 2008, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V22, P1203, DOI 10.1007/s11269-007-9221-9; Yang CC, 2008, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V22, P1561, DOI 10.1007/s11269-008-9243-y; YOUNG RA, 1989, J SOIL WATER CONSERV, V44, P168; Arnold J.G., 1998, WATER RESOUR RES, V34, P73, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1752-1688.1998.TB05961.X; Bagheri A, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V20, P391; Bednar D, 2004, P 10 C COMP STUDENT, P238; Belkhouche B, 1999, J WATER RES PL-ASCE, V125, P289, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1999)125:5(289); Beven K., 1987, 98 I HYDR; Crawford N.

Charitable lotteries are often portrayed as good works', and recently, hospitals have utilized them as a popular fundraising vehicle to raise necessary funds to help achieve organizational goals and objectives. Research indicates that lotteries contribute to gambling-related harms; however, research into charitable lotteries has been underdeveloped. Both the gambling and the health care industries are complex and evolving, consisting of many interacting stakeholders with often different and competing interests. This article seeks to present systems thinking as a conceptual framework to help fill the gap in understanding the use of gambling within hospitals and its possible benefits and unforeseen negative consequences. Addressing the gap in knowledge is important to help inform decision making aimed at reducing gambling-related harms. MethodThis article proposes how the school of systems thinking, specifically framing hospitals as complex adaptive systems and system dynamics modelling, can be utilized to understand the policy implications of the adoption of lotteries as a revenue source for hospitals. ConclusionHospitals have a duty to care, inform and protect. Hospital charitable lotteries have become big business; however, its incorporation into critical funding strategies needs to be carefully understood. Systems thinking theory and methodologies provide an integrated approach to examine this dynamic and evolving fundraising initiative. Findings from this article can inform the development of action strategies, including policy development at multiple levels.","[Reynolds, Jennifer] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada","Reynolds, J (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Hlth Sci Bldg,155 Coll St Rm 500, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada.",jennifer.reynolds@utoronto.ca,,,Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) Doctoral Fellowship Awards,"Jennifer Reynolds is a doctoral candidate at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, and was supported through the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) Doctoral Fellowship Awards.","Adams PJ, 2008, ROUTL STUD SOC POLIT, V53, P1; Adams P., 2006, J GAMBLING ISSUES, V17, DOI 10.4309/jgi.2006.17.1; Alvesson M., 1996, HDB ORG STUDIES, P191; Hoard M, 2005, INT J HYG ENVIR HEAL, V208, P117, DOI 10.1016/j.ijheh.2005.01.011; Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; Galea S, 2009, INT J DRUG POLICY, V20, P209, DOI 10.1016/j.drugpo.2008.08.005; Jones AP, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P488, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.063529; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Topolski S, 2009, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V15, P749, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01227.x; Bandura A, 2004, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V31, P143, DOI 10.1177/1090198104263660; Chaerul M, 2008, WASTE MANAGE, V28, P442, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2007.01.007; Petry NM, 2003, ADDICTION, V98, P645, DOI 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00336.x; Cabrera D, 2008, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V31, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.12.001; [Anonymous], 2010, LOTTERY GAMBLING REV; McDaniel RR, 2009, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V34, P191, DOI 10.1097/HMR.0b013e31819c8b38; Norman CD, 2009, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V15, P868, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01273.x; Tengs TO, 2001, PREV MED, V33, P558, DOI 10.1006/pmed.2001.0922; Adams PJ, 2007, ADDICTION, V102, P1027, DOI 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01829.x; Hardoon KK, 2001, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V57, P749, DOI 10.1002/jclp.1047; Ariyabuddhiphongs V., 2006, INT GAMBL STUD, V6, P77, DOI 10.1080/14459790600644218; Azmier J., 2000, ETHICS CHARITABLE GA; Baranowski T, 2002, HLTH BEHAV HLTH ED T, P165; Barnes M., 2003, EVALUATION, V9, P265, DOI 10.1177/13563890030093003; Canadian Partnership for Responsible Gambling, 2010, CAN GAMBL DIG 2008 2; Cosgrave J., 2009, CASINO STATE LEGALIZ; Frost R O, 2001, J Gambl Stud, V17, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1016636214258; Griffiths M., 2001, INT GAMBLING STUDIES, V1, P27, DOI [10.1080/14459800108732286, DOI 10.1080/14459800108732286]; Hraba J, 1990, J Gambl Stud, V6, P355, DOI 10.1007/BF01014590; Industry information/lottery industry [database on the Internet], 2009, SCI GAM; Jackson M.C., 2003, SYSTEMS THINKING CRE; Jones A., 2007, PREVENTING CHRONIC D, V4, P1; Jordon M, 2010, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V16, P228, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01359.x; Kernick D, 2004, COMPLEXITY HEALTHCAR; Korn D., 2007, HOSP GAMBLING PUBLIC; Korn DA, 1999, J GAMBL STUD, V15, P289, DOI 10.1023/A:1023005115932; LADOUCEUR R, 1994, BEHAV MODIF, V18, P230, DOI 10.1177/01454455940182006; Leischow SJ, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, pS196, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.014; Levy David T, 2002, Health Care Manag Sci, V5, P113, DOI 10.1023/A:1014476916361; Lorenz V C, 1990, J Gambl Stud, V6, P383, DOI 10.1007/BF01014592; Meadows D., 2008, THINKING SYSTEMS; National Cancer Institute, 2007, NIH PUB, V18; North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, 2010, LOTT HIST; PWC, 2002, EXPL POSS OV EX NEW; Responsible Gambling Council, 2006, GAMBL PROBL GAMBL ON; Richmond B, 2005, INTRO SYSTEMS THINKI; ROBERTS EB, 1982, INT J BIOMED COMPUT, V13, P69, DOI 10.1016/0020-7101(82)90051-4; Rush B., 2004, TREATMENT PROBLEM GA; Sterman JD, 2000, BUSINESS DYNAMICS SY; Vaillancourt F., 2000, GAMBLING GOVT CANADA; WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Promotion in Hospitals and Health Care, 2010, PUTT POL ACT; Willmann G., 1999, HIST LOTTERIES UNPUB; Wolff R, 2011, INT J MENT HEALTH AD, V9, P136, DOI 10.1007/s11469-010-9269-2",53,0,0,2,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1356-1294,1365-2753,,J EVAL CLIN PRACT,J.

Model-based approaches to software development and systems engineering use technologies to include graphical modeling languages, such as the Systems Modeling Language, that support system design and analysis through machine readable models. This paper traces key historical contributions of software and systems engineers over the past five decades to show a coherent concept of models and how they can be used for software and systems engineering. Recent model-based systems engineering methodologies supported by commercially available modeling tools are also summarized. Relational orientation is seen to be the underlying viewpoint that expresses and binds these approaches. Relational orientation for systems engineering (ROSE) is then specified using a general systems methodology. Systems are seen to access each other's models in ROSE much like classes in object orientation access each other's objects. Object-oriented frames for software engineering are extended to relational frames to specify an innovative framework for system design and analysis. This generalizes the axiomatic design approach of N. P. Suh. A repeatable procedure supporting greater concurrency between design and verification is also demonstrated for searching the solution space in linear axiomatic design.","[Dickerson, Charles E.] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Mavris, Dimitri] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Dickerson, CE (reprint author), Univ Loughborough, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.dickerson@lboro.ac.uk,,,"Royal Academy of Engineering; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, U.K.","This work was supported in part by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, U.K.","Chen P.

In the developmental psychopathology approach, two primary assumptions emphasize the importance of systems thinking and the utility of multilevel analyses. As will be illustrated here, these emphases are inextricably linked: a systems approach necessitates a multilevel approach, such that a level of organization must bring coherence to a level of mechanisms. Given this assumption, coming to an integrative understanding of the relation between levels is of central importance. One broad framework for this endeavor is relational developmental systems, which has been proposed by certain theorists as a new paradigm for developmental science. The implications of embracing this framework include the potential to connect developmental psychopathology with other approaches that emphasize systems thinking and that take an integrative perspective on the problem of levels of analysis.","[Marshall, Peter J.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Marshall, PJ (reprint author), Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, 1701 North 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",peter.marshall@temple.edu,,,,,"Ellis BJ, 2012, DEV PSYCHOL, V48, P591, DOI 10.1037/a0027651; Robert JS, 2001, BIOESSAYS, V23, P954, DOI 10.1002/bies.1136; Gilbert SF, 2000, DEV DYNAM, V219, P1, DOI 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999<::AID-DVDY1036>3.0.CO;2-A; Curran PJ, 2003, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V15, P581, DOI 10.1017/S0954579403000300; Wahlsten D, 2012, DEV PSYCHOBIOL, V54, P475, DOI 10.1002/dev.21043; van Geert P, 2011, CHILD DEV PERSPECT, V5, P273, DOI 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00197.x; Spemann H, 2001, INT J DEV BIOL, V45, P13; Witherington DC, 2011, HUM DEV, V54, P66, DOI 10.1159/000326814; Miller GA, 2010, PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI, V5, P716, DOI 10.1177/1745691610388774; Miller GA, 2003, TRENDS COGN SCI, V7, P141, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9; Pradeu Thomas, 2010, Biology Theory, V5, P216; Ricco RB, 2011, DEV REV, V31, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.dr.2011.07.005; Shea N, 2011, PHILOS SCI, V78, P60, DOI 10.1086/658110; Stotz K, 2008, PHILOS PSYCHOL, V21, P359, DOI 10.1080/09515080802200981; Kiverstein J, 2012, TOP COGN SCI, V4, P740, DOI 10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01219.x; Overton WF, 2012, BEHAV BRAIN SCI, V35, P375, DOI 10.1017/S0140525X12001082; Gilbert SF, 2001, DEV BIOL, V233, P1, DOI 10.1006/dbio.2001.0210; TVERSKY A, 1974, SCIENCE, V185, P1124, DOI 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124; Granic I, 2006, PSYCHOL REV, V113, P101, DOI 10.1037/0033-295X.113.1.101; Brunetti CR, 2001, CURR BIOL, V11, P1578, DOI 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00502-4; GARMEZY N, 1984, CHILD DEV, V55, P97, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00276.x; Beauchaine TP, 2008, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V20, P745, DOI 10.1017/S0954579408000369; Gottlieb G, 1998, PSYCHOL REV, V105, P792, DOI 10.1037/0033-295X.105.4.792-802; Kendler KS, 2012, MOL PSYCHIATR, V17, P377, DOI 10.1038/mp.2011.182; SEARLE JR, 1980, BEHAV BRAIN SCI, V3, P417; SROUFE LA, 1984, CHILD DEV, V55, P17, DOI 10.2307/1129832; Rutter M, 2012, EUR J DEV PSYCHOL, V9, P391, DOI 10.1080/17405629.2012.661174; Sterba SK, 2010, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V22, P239, DOI 10.1017/S0954579410000015; Marshall PJ, 2012, EARLY EDUC DEV, V23, P4, DOI 10.1080/10409289.2011.616134; GRIFFITHS PE, 1994, J PHILOS, V91, P277, DOI 10.2307/2940982; Meaney MJ, 2010, CHILD DEV, V81, P41, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01381.x; Lickliter R, 2003, PSYCHOL BULL, V129, P819, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.819; Overton WF, 2013, ADV CHILD DEV BEHAV, V44, P21, DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-397947-6.00002-7; Griffiths PE, 1998, PHILOS SCI, V65, P253, DOI 10.1086/392636; Hollenstein T, 2011, CHILD DEV PERSPECT, V5, P256, DOI 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00210.x; Cicchetti D, 2007, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V19, P627, DOI 10.1017/S0954579407000314; Jablonka E, 2009, Q REV BIOL, V84, P131; Addington AM, 2012, J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC, V53, P510, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02478.x; von Eye A, 2010, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V22, P277, DOI 10.1017/S0954579410000052; Charney E, 2012, BEHAV BRAIN SCI, V35, P331, DOI 10.1017/S0140525X11002226; Cicchetti D, 1996, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V8, P597; Burnette ML, 2012, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V24, P703, DOI 10.1017/S0954579412000314; Cicchetti D, 1999, DEV PSYCHOPATHOL, V11, P375, DOI 10.1017/S0954579499002114; Rudel D, 2003, DEV BIOL, V264, P15, DOI 10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00353-1; [Anonymous], 2008, J SPECUL PHILOS, V22, P159; Gottlieb G, 2007, DEVELOPMENTAL SCI, V10, P1, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00556.x; Lerner RM, 2008, J ADOLESCENT RES, V23, P245, DOI 10.1177/0743558408314385; Bergman L.

For the uncertainty analysis, the Monte Carlo procedure is used to propagate input uncertainty, while for sensitivity analysis, global methods including the standardized regression coefficients (SRC) and Morris screening are used to identify the most significant parameters. The potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystallization process is used as a case study, both in open-loop and closed-loop operation. In the uncertainty analysis, the impact on the predicted output of uncertain parameters related to the nucleation and the crystal growth model has been investigated for both a one- and two-dimensional crystal size distribution (CSD). The open-loop results show that the input uncertainties lead to significant uncertainties on the CSD, with appearance of a secondary peak due to secondary nucleation for both cases. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the most important parameters affecting the CSDs are nucleation order and growth order constants. In the proposed PAT system design (closed-loop), the target CSD variability was successfully reduced compared to the open-loop case, also when considering uncertainty in nucleation and crystal growth model parameters. The latter forms a strong indication of the robustness of the proposed PAT system design in achieving the target CSD and encourages its transfer to full-scale implementation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The scientific program will cover the full spectrum of challenges in antibody research and development, and provide updates on recent progress in areas from basic science through approval of antibody therapeutics. Keynote presentations will be given by Leroy Hood (Institute of System Biology), who will discuss a systems approach for studying disease that is enabled by emerging technology; Douglas Lauffenburger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), who will discuss systems analysis of cell communication network dynamics for therapeutic biologics design; David Baker (University of Washington), who will describe computer-based design of smart protein therapeutics; and William Schief (The Scripps Research Institute), who will discuss epitope-focused immunogen design. In this preview of the conference, the workshop and session chairs share their thoughts on what conference participants may learn in sessions on: (1) three-dimensional structure antibody modeling; (2) identifying clonal lineages from next-generation data sets of expressed V-H gene sequences; (3) antibodies in cardiometabolic medicine; (4) the effects of antibody gene variation and usage on the antibody response; (5) directed evolution; (6) antibody pharmacokinetics, distribution and off-target toxicity; (7) use of knowledge-based design to guide development of complementarity-determining regions and epitopes to engineer or elicit the desired antibody; (8) optimizing antibody formats for immunotherapy; (9) antibodies in a complex environment; (10) polyclonal, oligoclonal and bispecific antibodies; (11) antibodies to watch in 2014; and (12) polyreactive antibodies and polyspecificity.","[Almagro, Juan Carlos] Pfizer, Boston, MA USA; [Gilliland, Gary L.] Janssen Res & Dev LLC, Spring House, PA USA; [Scott, Jamie] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Larrick, James W.] Veloc Pharmaceut Dev, San Francisco, CA USA; [Plueckthun, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Veldman, Trudi] AbbVie Biores Ctr, Worcester, MA USA; [Adams, Gregory P.] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA; [Parren, Paul W.

Here, we provide a synoptic global assessment of the simultaneous changes in future ocean biogeochemical variables over marine biota and their broader implications for people. We analyzed modern Earth System Models forced by greenhouse gas concentration pathways until 2100 and showed that the entire world's ocean surface will be simultaneously impacted by varying intensities of ocean warming, acidification, oxygen depletion, or shortfalls in productivity. In contrast, only a small fraction of the world's ocean surface, mostly in polar regions, will experience increased oxygenation and productivity, while almost nowhere will there be ocean cooling or pH elevation. We compiled the global distribution of 32 marine habitats and biodiversity hotspots and found that they would all experience simultaneous exposure to changes in multiple biogeochemical variables. This superposition highlights the high risk for synergistic ecosystem responses, the suite of physiological adaptations needed to cope with future climate change, and the potential for reorganization of global biodiversity patterns. If co-occurring biogeochemical changes influence the delivery of ocean goods and services, then they could also have a considerable effect on human welfare. Approximately 470 to 870 million of the poorest people in the world rely heavily on the ocean for food, jobs, and revenues and live in countries that will be most affected by simultaneous changes in ocean biogeochemistry. These results highlight the high risk of degradation of marine ecosystems and associated human hardship expected in a future following current trends in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.","[Mora, Camilo; Chen, Qi] Univ Hawaii, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wei, Chih-Lin] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ctr Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada; [Rollo, Audrey] Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Amaro, Teresa] Norwegian Inst Water Res, Bergen, Norway; [Baco, Amy R.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Billett, David; Gooday, Andrew J.; Jones, Daniel O.

This paper provides a state of science commentary using four examples of HFE in healthcare to review and discuss analytical and implementation challenges and to identify future issues for HFE. The examples include two domain areas (occupational ergonomics and surgical safety) to illustrate a traditional application of HFE and the area that has probably received the most research attention. The other two examples show how systems and design have been addressed in healthcare with theoretical approaches for organisational and socio-technical systems and design for patient safety. Future opportunities are identified to develop and embed HFE systems thinking in healthcare including new theoretical models and long-term collaborative partnerships. HFE can contribute to systems and design initiatives for both patients and clinicians to improve everyday performance and safety, and help to reduce and control spiralling healthcare costs. Practitioner Summary: There has been an increase in the application of HFE techniques to healthcare delivery in the past 10 years. This paper provides a state of science commentary using four illustrative examples (occupational ergonomics, design for patient safety, surgical safety and organisational and socio-technical systems) to review and discuss analytical and implementation challenges and identify future issues for HFE.","[Hignett, Sue] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough Design Sch, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England;

Offering a case study of Rhodes University, the paper shows how the use of systems models and concepts, underpinned by a critical realist ontology and an understanding of morphogenetic change processes, have the potential to enable universities to mobilise their operations to respond to local sustainability challenges. In this instance, the success of such an approach is shown to depend on commitments from the university community and the availability of enabling inputs, such as financial and human resources. The paper concludes with reflections and recommendations to inform further development of a newly emerging systems approach in sustainability mainstreaming at Rhodes University, and other institutions pursuing similar approaches and goals.","[Togo, Muchaiteyi] Rhodes Univ, Res Directorate, South African Qualificat Author, Pretoria, South Africa; [Lotz-Sisitka, Heila] Rhodes Univ, Environm Learning & Res Ctr, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Togo, M (reprint author), Rhodes Univ, Res Directorate, South African Qualificat Author, Pretoria, South Africa.",mtogo@saqa.co.za,"Togo, Muchaiteyi/C-7415-2015","Togo, Muchaiteyi/0000-0001-6433-928X",,,"Folke C, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.002; Gilbert SF, 2000, DEV DYNAM, V219, P1, DOI 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999<::AID-DVDY1036>3.0.CO;2-A; Sterling S, 2004, HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CHALLENGE OF SUSTAINABILITY, P49, DOI 10.1007/0-306-48515-X_5; Fazey I, 2007, FRONT ECOL ENVIRON, V5, P375, DOI 10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[375:ACALTL]2.0.CO;2; Yeung HWC, 1997, PROG HUM GEOG, V21, P51, DOI 10.1191/030913297668207944; Laszlo KC, 2001, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V18, P379, DOI 10.1002/sres.442; Wright T, 2004, HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CHALLENGE OF SUSTAINABILITY, P7, DOI 10.1007/0-306-48515-X_2; Archer M.S., 1995, REALIST SOCIAL THEOR; Banathy B., 2000, 1 INT EL SEM WHOL IN; Banathy B., 1997, 1 INT EL SEM WHOL IN; Banathy B.

In this study, a system archetype known as growth and underinvestment is hypothesized to explain the eutrophication problem of Lake Allegan in Michigan and identify policy leverage points for mitigation. An integrated system dynamics model is developed to simulate the interaction between key socioeconomic subsystems and natural processes driving eutrophication. The model is applied to holistically characterize the lake's recovery from its hypereutrophic state and assess a number of proposed total maximum daily load (TMDL) reduction policies, including phosphorus load reductions from point sources and nonpoint sources. It is shown that for a TMDL plan to be effective, it should be considered a component of a continuous sustainability process, addressing the functionality of dynamic feedback relationships between socioeconomic growth, land use change, and environmental conditions.

Here, we review important issues concerning the collection of such data, and their processing and analysis, to identify the most promising approaches in the emerging field of 'reality mining'. Automated technologies can provide data sensing at time intervals small enough to close the gap between social patterns and their underlying processes, providing insights into how social structures arise and change dynamically over different timescales. Especially in conjunction with experimental manipulations, reality mining promises significant advances in basic and applied research on animal social systems.","[Krause, Jens; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Krause, Jens; Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Krause, Stefan] Lubeck Univ Appl Sci, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany; [Psorakis, Ioannis; Roberts, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Psorakis, Ioannis] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Rutz, Christian] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland","Krause, J (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",j.krause@igb-berlin.de; christian.rutz@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,BBSRC [BB/G023913/1]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [01UU0907]; BehaviourType project; Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz Association's Pact for Innovation and Research,"We would like to thank Z.

Some of this biomass comprises common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most widespread vascular plants on Earth. Reed utilisation from eutrophied coastal areas needs to be evaluated. Therefore, a system analysis was performed of reed harvesting for biofuel and biofertiliser production. The specific objectives of the analysis were to: investigate the methane yield associated with anaerobic co-digestion of reed; make a primary energy assessment of the system; quantify Greenhouse Gas (GHG) savings when a fossil reference system is replaced; and estimate the nutrient recycling potential of the system. The results from energy and GHG calculations are highly dependent on conditions such as system boundaries, system design, allocation methods and selected indicators. Therefore a pilot project taking place in Kalmar County, Sweden, was used as a case study system. Laboratory experiments using continuously stirred tank reactor digesters indicated an increased methane yield of about 220 m(3) CH4/t volatile solids from co-digestion of reed. The energy balance for the case study system was positive, with energy requirements amounting to about 40% of the energy content in the biomethane produced and with the non-renewable energy input comprising about 50% of the total energy requirements of the system. The net energy value proved to be equivalent to about 40 L of petrol/t reed wet weight. The potential to save GHG emissions compared with a fossil reference system was considerable (about 80%). Furthermore an estimated 60% of the nitrogen and almost all the phosphorus in the biomass could be re-circulated to arable land as biofertiliser. Considering the combined benefits from all factors investigated in this study, harvesting of common reed from coastal zones has the potential to be beneficial, assuming an appropriate system design, and is worthy of further investigations regarding other sustainability aspects.

Preterm infants are, especially, at risk for auditory and neurocognitive development. Sound levels are very high at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and may contribute to the frequently observed detrimental outcomes of prematurely born infants. Despite efforts to reduce noise level at the NICU, these have not changed over the past years. Although many authors indicate that a systems approach could solve such interrelated problems, methods to do so are generally lacking for the complicated situation in a critical care setting. A new approach was developed, that is, combining Fuzzy Front End earliest stage product development and human factors methods, with a focus on all Human-tech levels and on their interaction. A concept built up from several emerging technologies was developed, including tactile alarms, artificial intelligence for medicine, multimodal alarm system and mobile communication in critical care. Current and envisioned nursing work was modelled.

Using the results of a Web-based survey and face-to-face focus group this study was designed to advance our understanding of teacher adoption of systems thinking and system dynamics modeling by documenting the perspective of a large group in an urban context tasked with a curriculum that included system dynamics simulations. Teachers identified the barriers to implementing simulation activities as both computer access and their own understanding. A test of teachers' understanding of systems principles reveals inconsistencies in the way they interpret models, based on their previous understanding of the system. Strategies for addressing these issues include professional development that targets teacher self-efficacy, understanding of systems and system models, as well as the provision of materials for model-building and simulation use.

Recent work has investigated new thermoelectric (TE) materials and systems that can operate at higher performance levels and show a viable pathway to lightweight, small-form-factor, advanced thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems to recover waste heat in many of these applications. New TE materials include nanocomposite materials such as lead-antimony-silver-telluride (LAST) and lead-antimony-silver-tin-telluride (LASTT) compounds. These new materials have created opportunities for high-performance, segmented-element TE devices. New higher-performance TE devices segmenting LAST/LASTT materials with bismuth telluride have been designed and fabricated. Sectioned TEG systems using these new TE devices and materials have been designed. Integrated heat exchanger/TE device system analyses of sectioned TE system designs have been performed, creating unique efficiency-power maps that provide better understanding and comparisons of design tradeoffs and nominal and off-nominal system performance conditions. New design perspectives and mathematical foundations in optimization of sectioned TE design approaches are discussed that provide insight on how to optimize such sectioned TE systems. System performance analyses using ANSYS(A (R)) TE modeling capabilities have integrated heat exchanger performance models with ANSYS(A (R)) TE models to extend its analysis capabilities beyond simple constant hot-side and cold-side temperature conditions. Analysis results portray external resistance effects, matched load conditions, and maximum power versus maximum efficiency points simultaneously, and show that maximum TE power occurs at external resistances slightly greater than the TE module internal resistances in these systems. Mathematical relationships are given providing the foundation for this phenomenon.","[Hendricks, Terry J.] Battelle Mem Inst, Columbus, OH 43201 USA; [Karri, Naveen K.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Hogan, Tim P.] Michigan State Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Cauchy, Charles J.] Promethient LLC, Traverse City, MI 49686 USA","Hendricks, TJ (reprint author), Battelle Mem Inst, 505 King Ave, Columbus, OH 43201 USA.",hendrickst@battelle.org,,,,,"Angrist S.

Study design From our national databases 2000-2010 and previous studies, we obtained the epidemiologic data to develop and validate system dynamics models. Population model incorporated birth rate and mortality. KD model incorporated the population at risk, incidence, and risk of coronary complications. Results The average annual incidence in age group <5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 years was 67.3, 5.75, 0.79, and 0.26 per 100 000. The KD population was 23 349 and the model estimated 20 254 patients with KD, and 25% of these patients received medical care or continued surveillance in 2010. Projection up to 2030 suggests an average of 725 new patients with KD annually and a KD population of 35 006 by 2030. In 2030, 1469 patients with KD will need medical care for coronary complications. Simulation on the model modified to US data is also effective and suggests an average of 6200 new patients annually and KD population of 161 776 by 2030, and 5664 patients will need coronary care in 2030.

Several authors have suggested that earthquake dynamics and the dynamics of economic (financial) systems can be analyzed within similar mathematical frameworks. We apply concepts of the nonextensive statistical physics, on time-series data of observable manifestations of the underlying complex processes ending up with these different extreme events, in order to support the suggestion that a dynamical analogy exists between a financial crisis (in the form of share or index price collapse) and a single earthquake. We also investigate the existence of such an analogy by means of scale-free statistics (the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of event sizes). We show that the populations of: (i) fracto-electromagnetic events rooted in the activation of a single fault, emerging prior to a significant earthquake, (ii) the trade volume events of different shares/economic indices, prior to a collapse, and (iii) the price fluctuation (considered as the difference of maximum minus minimum price within a day) events of different shares/economic indices, prior to a collapse, follow both the traditional Gutenberg-Richter law as well as a nonextensive model for earthquake dynamics, with similar parameter values. The obtained results imply the existence of a dynamic analogy between earthquakes and economic crises, which moreover follow the dynamics of seizures, magnetic storms and solar flares.

The components are a miniaturized eight-channel peristaltic pump, an eight-channel valve, sample-to-waste liquid management, and interconnections. The library of components was tested by constructing various systems supporting perfusion cell culture, automated DNA hybridizations, and in situ hybridizations. The results showed that the MainSTREAM components provided (1) a rapid, robust, and simple method to establish numerous fluidic inputs and outputs to various types of reaction chips; (2) highly parallel pumping and routing/valving capability; (3) methods to interface pumps and chip-to-liquid management systems; (4) means to construct a portable system; (5) reconfigurability/flexibility in system design; (6) means to interface to microscopes; and (7) compatibility with tested biological methods. It was found that LEGO Mindstorms motors, controllers, and software were robust, inexpensive, and an accessible choice as compared with corresponding custom-made actuators. MainSTREAM systems could operate continuously for weeks without leaks, contamination, or system failures.

From a biomedical perspective, the system is based on the well-known fact that Heart Rate (HR) signals indicate the activity of autonomous nervous system and therefore such signals are used to investigate the cardiac health of patients. HR signals are highly nonlinear and non-stationary in nature. Hence, we have extracted the salient features using nonlinear signal processing techniques. In this work, we have analysed 285 subjects from eight different cardiac classes. The features extracted are: Normalized bispectrum entropies (P1 and P2), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn) and Recurrence Entropy (REN). Furthermore, we propose a Cardiac Integrated Index (CII) using different entropies. This one value CII can be used to differentiate normal and abnormal cardiac classes. During the work on signal analysis we realized that proposing and testing of algorithms is done in the requirements phase of the systems design. This is an important realization, because it puts the work on algorithms in perspective to all the design steps necessary to build a physical solution for the important problem of cardiac monitoring.","[Acharya, U.

Local management schemes view water quality as a high-priority environmental objective. In practice, how far this objective is achieved depends on trade-offs between the costs of improved water treatment facilities and the acceptable impacts of water contamination. An in-the-field experiment in collaboration with local managers was carried out in the Thau lagoon on the French Mediterranean coast during the SPICOSA (Science and Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment) project, from 2007 through 2011. It consisted of building a modeling platform and an integrated assessment framework for simulating exploratory scenarios. The modeling platform combines a dynamic contamination model, which represents the sources of microbiological contamination, wastewater treatment facilities, and physical mechanisms of lagoon contamination, with a prospective economic model, which estimates the patterns of development of economic activities in the area through a holistic approach. Exploratory scenarios are used to assess the risk of water contamination and the efficiency of management measures, under various assumptions about the evolution of the system. The contamination simulations suggest that the work currently planned by local authorities will be inadequate for preventing increased water pollution, and that additional but fairly inexpensive management measures for maintaining the current level of water quality should be considered. The integrated assessment framework estimates the ecological and socio-economic impacts of the various pollution mitigation policies in the broader context of possible local development patterns.

To avert impending crises in water scarcity and food security many nations are reshaping the priorities, regimes, and praxis of fresh water resource management to explicitly recognize and address diverse human and ecological needs. A recent United Nations sponsored study documenting the linkages between water, cultural diversity, and global environmental change argues that a coupled bio/social systems approach to watershed management prioritizing biocultural health over other concerns is needed to achieve sustainability goals, address the complex and protracted conflicts that characterize river basin management, and halt biocultural degeneration. Praxis implications include (1) the need for greater respect for and recognition of the rights, values, and contributions of culturally diverse peoples in the management and use of river systems, (2) expansion of the integrated water resource management model to include prioritized allocation of water to meet environmental and cultural flows.","Ctr Polit Ecol, Santa Cruz, CA 95061 USA","Johnston, BR (reprint author), Ctr Polit Ecol, Santa Cruz, CA 95061 USA.",bjohnston@igc.org,,,NSF [EAR-1039127]; Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations in Australia,"The author wishes to thank W.

Policies which integrate the supply and demand are needed to address the water stress issues. An object-oriented system dynamics model was developed to capture the interrelationships between water availability and increasing water demands from the growth of industries, agricultural production and the population through modeling the decision-making process of the water exploration explicitly, in which water stress is used as a major indicator. The model is composed of four sectors: 1) natural surface and groundwater resources; 2) water demand; 3) the water exploitation process, including the decision to build reservoirs, canals and pumps; 4) water stress to which political and social systems respond through increasing the supply, limiting the growth or improving the water use efficiency. The model was calibrated using data from 1949 to 2009 for population growth, irrigated land area, industry output, perceived water stress, groundwater resources availability and the drying-out process of Manas River; and simulations were carried out from 2010 to 2050 on an annual time step. The comparison of results from calibration and observation showed that the model corresponds to observed behavior, and the simulated values fit the observed data and trends accurately. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is robust to changes in model parameters related to population growth, land reclamation, pumping capacity and capital contribution to industry development capacity. Six scenarios were designed to investigate the effectiveness of policy options in the area of reservoir relocation, urban water recycling, water demand control and groundwater pumping control. The simulation runs demonstrated that the technical solutions for improving water availability and water use efficiency are not sustainable. Acknowledging the carrying capacity of water resources and eliminating a growth-orientated value system are crucial for the sustainability of the Manas River Basin.","[Dai, ShanShan] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Hospitality & Tourism Management, Macao 999078, Peoples R China; [Li, LanHai; Pan, XiangLiang; Li, XueMei] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Li, LanHai; Li, XueMei] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Key Lab Water Cycle & Utilizat Arid Zone, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Xu, HongGang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Li, LH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",lilh@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"pan, xiangliang/I-1466-2014; ye, zhaoxia/E-3594-2015; ","_, __/0000-0003-4573-6284","National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB951004]; Xinjiang Key Lab of Water Cycle and Utilization in Arid Zone, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences [XJYS0907-2009-02]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB951004) and a project of Xinjiang Key Lab of Water Cycle and Utilization in Arid Zone, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (XJYS0907-2009-02).","Rauch W, 2002, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V45, P81; Gunderson LH, 2006, ECOL SOC, V11; Evans TP, 2001, ECOL MODEL, V143, P95, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3800(01)00357-X; Rykiel EJ, 1996, ECOL MODEL, V90, P229, DOI 10.1016/0304-3800(95)00152-2; Ahmad S, 2000, J COMPUT CIVIL ENG, V14, P190, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2000)14:3(190); Ahmad S, 2006, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V20, P391, DOI 10.1007/s11269-006-0326-3; Saysel AK, 2002, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V64, P247, DOI 10.1006/jema.2001.0488; Ling HB, 2012, J ARID LAND, V4, P271, DOI 10.3724/SP.J.1227.2012.00271; Chu JY, 2009, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V23, P3267, DOI 10.1007/s11269-009-9433-2; Li L, 2002, HYDROL PROCESS, V16, P2645, DOI 10.1002/hyp.1064; Gastelum JR, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P1285, DOI 10.1007/s11269-009-9497-z; Li L, 2003, AQUACULT ENG, V27, P9, DOI 10.1016/S0144-8609(02)00037-7; Winz I, 2009, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V23, P1301, DOI 10.1007/s11269-008-9328-7; Ahmad S, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P3371, DOI 10.1007/s11269-010-9611-2; Falkenmark M, 1997, HYDROLOG SCI J, V42, P451, DOI 10.1080/02626669709492046; Tidwell VC, 2004, AQUAT SCI, V66, P357, DOI 10.1007/s00027-004-0722-9; Simonovic SP, 1999, WATER RESOUR RES, V35, P295, DOI 10.1029/1998WR900023; Cheng WM, 2006, SCI CHINA SER D, V49, P163, DOI 10.1007/s11430-004-5348-1; Xu ZX, 2002, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V16, P239, DOI 10.1023/A:1020206826669; Berkes F., 1998, LINKING SOCIAL ECOLO; Cheng WM, 2003, THESIS CHINESE ACAD; Chow GC, 2002, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V51, P247, DOI 10.1086/344158; Compiling Committee Shihezi County Annals, 1994, SHIHEZI COUNTY ANN; De Marsily G, 1986, QUANTITATIVE HYDROGE; Fernandez JM, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P117, DOI 10.1002/sdr.290; Ford A., 1999, MODELING ENV INTRO S; Forrester J.

Several authors have suggested that earthquake dynamics and neurodynamics can be analyzed within similar mathematical frameworks. Recently, authors have shown that a dynamical analogy supported by scale-free statistics exists between seizures and earthquakes, analyzing populations of different seizures and earthquakes, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a shift in emphasis from the large to the small scale: our analyses focus on a single epileptic seizure generation and the activation of a single fault (earthquake) and not on the statistics of sequences of different seizures and earthquakes. We apply the concepts of the nonextensive statistical physics to support the suggestion that a dynamical analogy exists between the two different extreme events, seizures and earthquakes. We also investigate the existence of such an analogy by means of scale-free statistics (the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of event sizes and the distribution of the waiting time until the next event).

It has been suggested that internal dynamics of genomic modifications as opposed to the external evolutionary forces have a significant and complex impact on Darwinian species evolution. A similar situation can be expected for somatic cancer evolution as molecular key mechanisms encountered in species evolution also constitute prevalent mutation mechanisms in human cancers. This assumption is developed into a systems approach of carcinogenesis which focuses on possible inner constraints of the genome architecture on lineage selection during somatic cancer evolution. The proposed systems approach can be considered an analogy to the concept of evolvability in species evolution. The principal hypothesis is that permissive or restrictive effects of the genome architecture on lineage selection during somatic cancer evolution exist and have a measurable impact. The systems approach postulates three classes of lineage selection effects of the genome architecture on somatic cancer evolution: i) effects mediated by changes of fitness of cells of cancer lineage, ii) effects mediated by changes of mutation probabilities and iii) effects mediated by changes of gene designation and physical and functional genome redundancy. Physical genome redundancy is the copy number of identical genetic sequences. Functional genome redundancy of a gene or a regulatory element is defined as the number of different genetic elements, regardless of copy number, coding for the same specific biological function within a cancer cell. Complex interactions of the genome architecture on lineage selection may be expected when modifications of the genome architecture have multiple and possibly opposed effects which manifest themselves at disparate times and progression stages. Dissection of putative mechanisms mediating constraints exerted by the genome architecture on somatic cancer evolution may provide an algorithm for understanding and predicting as well as modifying somatic cancer evolution in individual patients.

Detecting and understanding the properties of such systems is of paramount importance to make effective decisions about risk management and sustainable development. This chapter presents a systems approach to risk management and risk-based decision making in infrastructure networks. In the proposed approach, the internal structure of a network is detected via pattern recognition (clustering), and structured information is used to enhance conceptual and computational analyses of reliability, vulnerability, damage propagation, and resource allocation. The approach can be applied to network analysis of complex infrastructure systems subjected to extreme events, such as earthquakes.","[Sanchez-Silva, M.; Gomez, C.] Univ Los Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bogota, Colombia","Sanchez-Silva, M (reprint author), Univ Los Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Mario Laserna Bldg,Carrera 1 East 19A-40, Bogota, Colombia.",msanchez@uniandes.edu.co,,,,,"ABBASS H, 2011, COMPUT INTELL MAG IE, V6, P30; ACKOFF RL, 1962, OPER RES QUART, V13, P1, DOI 10.2307/3007575; Newman MEJ, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P9564, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0610537104; Inokuchi R, 2004, IEEE INT CONF FUZZY, P1497; Song JH, 2003, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V129, P627, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2003)129:6(627); Bell MGH, 2008, PHILOS T R SOC A, V366, P1893, DOI 10.1098/rsta.2008.0019; Au SK, 2004, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V130, P303, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2004)130:3(303); Levi R, 2012, MATH PROGRAM, V131, P365, DOI 10.1007/s10107-010-0380-8; Au SK, 2001, PROBABILIST ENG MECH, V16, P263, DOI 10.1016/S0266-8920(01)00019-4; Chang YH, 2010, EXPERT SYST APPL, V37, P6919, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.03.030; Duenas-Osorio L, 2011, COMPUT-AIDED CIV INF, V26, P111, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00661.x; Barzel B, 2009, PHYS REV E, V80, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.80.046104; Watts DJ, 2004, ANNU REV SOCIOL, V30, P243, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.30.020404.104342; Duenas-Osorio L, 2007, J INFRASTRUCT SYST, V13, P185, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2007)13:3(185); Vanderbeck F, 2006, OPER RES LETT, V34, P296, DOI 10.1016/j.orl.2005.05.009; Gong BH, 2008, NEW J PHYS, V10, DOI 10.1088/1367-2630/10/1/013030; Newman MEJ, 2004, EUR PHYS J B, V38, P321, DOI 10.1140/epjb/e2004-00124-y; Graepel T, 1998, NEUROCOMPUTING, V21, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0925-2312(98)00035-6; Albert R, 2002, REV MOD PHYS, V74, P47, DOI 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.47; Au SK, 2003, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V129, P901, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2003)129:8(901); Scholkopf B, 1998, NEURAL COMPUT, V10, P1299, DOI 10.1162/089976698300017467; Hurtado JE, 2007, STRUCT SAF, V29, P2, DOI 10.1016/j.strusafe.2005.12.002; Ashby W.R, 1964, INTRO CYBERNETICS; Beer S., 1967, CYBERNETICS MANAGEME; Bell M.G.H., 1997, TRANSPORTATION NETWO; Berdica K., 2007, VULNERABILITY MODEL, P81; Blockley D.

As the torque limiter is a clutch body, when the external resistance is greater than or equal to the magnetic torque, the rotation of screw rod will stop but start sliding simultaneously. When the screw rod stops rotating, the shutter detection disk also stops rotating. Correspondingly, the pulse signal output of infrared optointerrupters stops. Therefore, the motor of MCU stops by precisely determining whether the screw rod is stopped by external force with the function of torque limiters well exerted. As such, a product advantaged with streamlined sizes, long life expectancy, higher stability, low cost and handy control is reachable.","[Lai, Po-Szu; Yang, I-Chiang; Juan, Yu-Lin; Chen, Tsair-Rong] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Elect Engn, Changhua 500, Taiwan","Lai, PS (reprint author), Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Elect Engn, Bao Shan Campus,2,Shi Da Rd, Changhua 500, Taiwan.",hirolai0219@yahoo.com.tw; feiloli.yang@msa.hinet.net; yljuan0815@cc.ncue.edu.tw; abc@abc.ncue.edu.tw; kchen@dragon.ccut.edu.tw,,,,,"*AGIS MAG, 2010, AGIS MAGAZINE; Ozturk SB, 2011, IEEE-ASME T MECH, V16, P351, DOI 10.1109/TMECH.2010.2043742; Sahoo SK, 2012, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V27, P555, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2011.2132740; Lu KY, 2011, IEEE T IND APPL, V47, P314, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2010.2091189; Bateman CJ, 2010, IEEE T IND APPL, V46, P2329, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2010.2070471; Neuhaus CR, 2008, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V23, P2557, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002086; Calcutt D.

The resulting model is more useful than traditional documentation because it represents structure, data, and functions, along with associated documentation, in a multidimensional, navigable format. Beyond benefits to project documentation and stakeholder communication, UML- and SysML-based models also support direct analysis methods, such as functional thread extraction.

However, the overall future land subsidence will keep the trend of slow growth; 3) Double the exploitation capacity in1998, the speed of land subsidence will be 41mm/a in 2020, the accumulative quantity of land subsidence will be close to 1m. According to the average high tide level (5.15m) in the Huangpu River in 2000-2008, the actual average high tide level of the Huangpu River will reach about 6m and exceed the orange warning response against flood and typhoon in Shanghai.

However there is an increasing demand on maintenance and operational improvements since turbines have been plagued with downtime problems of major components e.g. gearboxes and generators, especially with offshore turbines which are difficult to access. Reliability Centric Maintenance (RCM) is a way of capturing the potential causes of downtime and poor performance by preventing failures and having a proactive approach to operations and maintenance (O&M). However, for a large fleet of turbines, adopting the RCM approach becomes difficult due to the complexities that arise as a result of the interactions between individual elements that make up the system in the product lifecycle. This paper discusses how a systems thinking approach can be used to identify the relevant aspects and possible interactions between the RCM approach and wind turbine gearboxes and also how the gaps that exist within the system can be closed so as to add value to business. The outcome of the paper is a proposal for applying a systems approach to wind turbine gearbox operation and maintenance, optimising the asset value adding contribution at minimal total cost to the operator.

S. and the U. K. In particular we focus on the debate between reductionism and holism which is one of the classical subjects of study in the philosophy of science. Just like the West, China experienced theoretical debate between holism and reductionism which spanned across a broad range of fields such as traditional Chinese medicine and reliability-centered systems engineering. The Chinese developed their own oriental systems methodologies based on the philosophical foundation of ancient oriental philosophy thoughts and dialectic principle, the most distinctive of which include the Meta-synthesis Approach and the Wuli-Shili-Renli approach. In the Western approach to systems thinking there are similar concepts of holistic thinking, synergism, and cause and effect. However, interesting differences exist between China and the West in the role of intuition in decision making. We explore these differences and discuss the implications for applying each approach in different problem solving contexts. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The economic and personal costs associated with these challenges are enormous. To address these challenges, APL, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the Whiting School of Engineering's Systems Institute have teamed to couple systems engineering principles and best practices with clinical expertise to develop innovative approaches to the socio-technical dynamics involved in health care. This work focuses on understanding the interactions among people (clinicians, patients, families, and other stakeholders), processes (institutional, regulatory, professional ethics, etc.), and technology (medical devices and instrumentation) in the health care domain to formulate a systems approach to innovations that lead to improved patient outcomes. APL and Johns Hopkins Medicine are collaborating on improvements at the device level, specifically medication infusion pumps that represent significant patient safety challenges, as well as at the unit level in the intensive care unit.","[Ravitz, Alan D.; Sapirstein, Adam; Pham, Julius C.; Doyle, Peter A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20703 USA","Ravitz, AD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20703 USA.",alan.ravitz@jhuapl.edu,,,WSE-SI; AHRQ [R18HS020460]; AHRQ,"The authors thank J.

A unified model derived from psychophysical axioms produces transparent network dynamics and principled parameter settings. DISCOV fits an array of physiological data for each cell type, and makes testable experimental predictions. Binary DISCOV augments an earlier version of the model to achieve stable computations for spatial data analysis. The model is described in terms of RGB images, but inputs may consist of any number of spatially defined components. System dynamics are derived using algebraic computations, and robust parameter ranges that meet experimental data are fully specified. Assuming default values, the only free parameter for the user to specify is the spatial scale. Multi-scale analysis accommodates items of various sizes and perspective. Image inputs are first processed by complement coding, which produces an ON channel stream and an OFF channel stream for each component. Subsequent computations are oncenter/off-surround, with the OFF channel replacing the off-center/on-surround fields of other models. Together with an orientation filter, DISCOV provides feature input vectors for an integrated recognition system. The development of DISCOV models is being carried out in the context of a large-scale research program that is integrating cognitive and neural systems derived from analyses of vision and recognition to produce both biological models and technological applications.

The topic and issues discussed in this paper are important because the subject of the role of SDL in autonomic systems engineering has not yet been explored due to the fact that the area of autonomic systems engineering is still a growing even though it is now a mature area. In this paper we investigate the role SDL should play in autonomic systems engineering. At the same time we raise a series of questions we believe both the research community and the industry at large need to consider in this context and come up with solutions that will solidify the role of SDL in such emerging domains. While we provide important insights, the goal is not to provide answers to each of the questions we raise in this study, but rather to discuss issues that both academia and the industry should seize within this growing area. The domain of Autonomic Networking is now seeing a Reference Model that defines the associated concepts of the domain, their relationships and constraints, being developed in ETSI - European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Thus, in this paper, we argue the need for the formalization of the Reference Model as a standardizable Meta-Model and present the role of SDL in a model-driven systems engineering methodology and associated tool-chain for designing stable autonomic systems.","[Chaparadza, Ranganai] ETSI AFI, IPv6 Forum, Aachen, Germany; [Prakash, Arun] Fraunhofer FOKUS Inst Open Commun Syst, Berlin, Germany","Chaparadza, R (reprint author), ETSI AFI, IPv6 Forum, Aachen, Germany.",ran4chap@yahoo.com; arun.prakash@fokus.fraunhofer.de,,,,,"Aldazabal A., 2008, ECMDA WORKSH MOD DRI; Duale AY, 2004, IEEE T COMPUT, V53, P614, DOI 10.1109/TC.2004.1275300; [Anonymous], 2013, 002 ETSI GS AFI; Batori G, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4735, P316; Bengtsson J., 1995, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V1066, P232; Camus J.-L., 2001, SDL 2001: Meeting UML. 10th International SDL Forum.

Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment of RA, novel molecular targets are still needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the therapeutic outcomes. Here, we present a systems approach that can effectively 1) identify core RA-associated genes (RAGs), 2) reconstruct RA-perturbed networks, and 3) select potential targets for diagnosis and treatments of RA. By integrating multiple gene expression datasets previously reported, we first identified 983 core RAGs that show RA dominant differential expression, compared to osteoarthritis (OA), in the multiple datasets. Using the core RAGs, we then reconstructed RA-perturbed networks that delineate key RA associated cellular processes and transcriptional regulation. The networks revealed that synovial fibroblasts play major roles in defining RA-perturbed processes, anti-TNF-alpha therapy restored many RA-perturbed processes, and 19 transcription factors (TFs) have major contribution to deregulation of the core RAGs in the RA-perturbed networks. Finally, we selected a list of potential molecular targets that can act as metrics or modulators of the RA-perturbed networks.

The authors propose that CBPR can benefit from a systems science framework to represent the complex and dynamic characteristics of a community and identify intervention points and potential ""tipping points."" Systems science refers to a field of study that posits a holistic framework that is focused on component parts of a system in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems. Systems thinking tools can assist in intervention planning by allowing all CBPR stakeholders to visualize how community factors are interrelated and by potentially identifying the most salient intervention points. To demonstrate the potential utility of systems science tools in CBPR, the authors show the use of causal loop diagrams by a community coalition engaged in CBPR activities regarding youth drinking reduction and prevention.","[BeLue, Rhonda] Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","BeLue, R (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rzb10@psu.edu,,"Lengerich, Eugene/0000-0001-9872-1647",,,"Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; Rahmandad H, 2008, MANAGE SCI, V54, P998, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1070.0787; FORRESTER JW, 1968, MANAGE SCI, V14, P398, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.14.7.398; Green LW, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P406, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066035; Fredericks KA, 2008, AM J EVAL, V29, P251, DOI 10.1177/1098214008319446; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Cavana RY, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P223, DOI 10.1002/sdr.294; Resnicow K, 2008, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V98, P1382, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2007.129460; TROCHIM WMK, 1994, J CONSULT CLIN PSYCH, V62, P766, DOI 10.1037/0022-006X.62.4.766; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; Burke JG, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P1392, DOI 10.1177/1049732305278876; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; KELDER SH, 1994, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V84, P1121, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.84.7.1121; Richardson GP, 1986, SYST DYNAM REV, V2, P158, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260020207; Cabrera D, 2008, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V31, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.12.001; Israel BA, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, P2094, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2009.170506; Wallerstein N, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, pS40, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2009.184036; Trochim W, 2005, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V17, P187, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzi038; Mabry PL, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, P1161, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2010.198176; Anderson RA, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P669, DOI 10.1177/1049732305275208; Livingood WC, 2011, AM J PREV MED, V41, P525, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2011.07.021; Bentley ME, 1998, AIDS, V12, P1869, DOI 10.1097/00002030-199814000-00019; Dinno A, 2008, SOC SCI MED, V66, P1448, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.12.032; FORRESTER JW, 1994, SYST DYNAM REV, V10, P245, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260100211; Gaventa J, 2002, CURRENTS, V28, P29; Holland J.

The dynamics of improvement of irrigation networks is studied, on the basis of indicators such as adequacy, efficiency, equity, flexibility and dependability. In the present paper, the application of system dynamics analysis is demonstrated by applying it to six irrigation areas in Iran to present irrigation causal loop diagrams. The results, specifically for the Qazvin irrigation network, have been documented based on the facts. For the Qazvin irrigation network, system utility not only improves through increase in investment planning, but through conjunctive water management, reducing social constraints, and control of crop patterns and the cultivated area. Reduction of social and legal constraints with change of structural and non-structural measures to longer-term sustainable measures is more effective than the other policies. As a conclusion it could be stated that the system dynamics approach can be successfully applied to integrated analysis of irrigation network policy options, as well as to identification of key factors leading to degradation of irrigation networks and how to make effective decisions to sustain system utility over time.

The Hominoidea share a set of social commonalities, notably a social niche that extends beyond kin and beyond the immediate social group, as well as extensive intraspecific flexibility in social organization. We propose that an essential feature of hominoid evolution is the shift from limited plasticity in a generalized social ape to expanded behavioral plasticity as an adaptive niche. Whereas in most nonhominoid primates variability and flexibility take the shape of specific patterns of demographic flux and interindividual relationships, we can consider behavioral flexibility and plasticity as a means to an end in hominoid socioecological landscapes. In addition, the potential for innovation, spread, and inheritance of behavioral patterns and social traditions is much higher in the hominoids, especially the great apes, than in other anthropoid primates. We further suggest that this pattern forms a basis for the substantial expansion of social complexity and adaptive behavioral plasticity in the hominins, especially the genus Homo. Our objectives in this article are threefold: 1) summarize the variation in the social systems of extant hominoid taxa; 2) consider the evolutionary processes underlying these variations; and 3) expand upon the traditional socioecological model, especially with respect to reconstructions of early hominin social behavior. We emphasize a central role for both ecological and social niche construction, as well as behavioral plasticity, as basal hominoid characteristics. Over evolutionary time these characteristics influence the patterns of selection pressures and the resulting social structures. We propose that a mosaic of ecological and social inheritance patterns should be considered in the reconstruction of early hominin social systems.","[Malone, N.] Univ Auckland, Dept Anthropol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Fuentes, A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Anthropol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [White, F.

Assuming that the degraded areas are hypersensitive to the initial conditions of soil preparation, we applied the technique to trigger the roughness over time emergent properties that speed up the process of environmental recovery. Was evaluated in the process of the evolution of environmental restoration components, soil, vegetation, wildlife, water and microclimate under the effect of roughness, as auxiliary components in the internalization of matter and energy in the degraded area. We compared the evolution of biotic and abiotic environmental variables in the model preparation of rugged terrain with the conventional model, consisting of flat surfaces and more regular. It was confirmed that the roughness behave as gravitational attractor generated islands of diversity, the system incorporates a dynamic hypersensitive to these initial conditions and act as nucleation triggering effect amplified by the feedback, which increase and accelerate the recovery environment. All biometric variables Mimosa scabrella species (height, stem diameter, DBH and crown area) and height of the spontaneous vegetation had faster growth in irregular areas, resulting in environmental changes of abiotic factors. It was concluded that the ecological model proposed and the practical results obtained validate the influence diagram as an important tool to understand the causal relationships and feedback of the variables and their temporal evolution in the process of environmental recovery.","[Loch, Carlos] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Tecnol, Dept Civil Engn, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Comin, Jucinei Jose] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Engn Rural, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",,aumond@furb.br; carlos.loch@ufsc.br; jcomin@cca.ufsc.br,,,,,"Anand M, 2004, RESTOR ECOL, V12, P117, DOI 10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00281.x; Regensburger B, 2008, CIENC RURAL, V38, P1773, DOI 10.1590/S0103-84782008000600046; Caldwell MM, 1998, J PHOTOCH PHOTOBIO B, V46, P40, DOI 10.1016/S1011-1344(98)00184-5; Lazzari SMN, 2005, REV BRAS ZOOL, V22, P891, DOI 10.1590/S0101-81752005000400013; Callaway RM, 1995, BOT REV, V61, P306, DOI 10.1007/BF02912621; ASSOCIACAO BRASILEIRA DE NORMAS TECNICAS - ABNT, 1999, 13030 ABNT NBR; AUMOND J.

In most cases human life directly depends on correct decisions made by these systems, therefore they have to work reliably. This paper describes how we applied systems engineering principles to design a high performance embedded classification system in a systematic and well structured way. We introduce the structured design approach by discussing requirements capturing, specifications refinement, implementation and testing. Thereby, we follow systems engineering principles and execute each of these processes as formal as possible. The requirements, which motivate the system design, describe an automated decision making system for diagnostic support. These requirements are refined into the implementation of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm which enables us to integrate automated decision making in embedded systems. With a formal model we establish functionality, stability and reliability of the system. Furthermore, we investigated different parallel processing configurations of this computationally complex algorithm. We found that, by adding SVM processes, an almost linear speedup is possible. Once we established these system properties, we translated the formal model into an implementation. The resulting implementation was tested using XMOS processors with both normal and failure cases, to build up trust in the implementation. Finally, we demonstrated that our parallel implementation achieves the speedup, predicted by the formal model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Specifically, the design framework focuses on organic chemistry based, active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthetic processes, but could potentially be extended to biocatalytic and fermentation-based products. The method exploits the synergic combination of continuous flow technologies (e.g., microfluidic techniques) and process systems engineering (PSE) methods and tools for faster process design and increased process understanding throughout the whole drug product and process development cycle. The design framework structures the many different and challenging design problems (e.g., solvent selection, reactor design, and design of separation and purification operations), driving the user from the initial drug discovery steps - where process knowledge is very limited - toward the detailed design and analysis. Examples from the literature of PSE methods and tools applied to pharmaceutical process design and novel pharmaceutical production technologies are provided along the text, assisting in the accumulation and interpretation of process knowledge. Different criteria are suggested for the selection of batch and continuous processes so that the whole design results in low capital and operational costs as well as low environmental footprint. The design framework has been applied to the retrofit of an existing batch-wise process used by H. Lundbeck A/S to produce an API: zuclopenthixol. Some of its batch operations were successfully converted into continuous mode, obtaining higher yields that allowed a significant simplification of the whole process. The material and environmental footprint of the process - evaluated through the process mass intensity index, that is, kg of material used per kg of product - was reduced to half of its initial value, with potential for further reduction. The case-study includes reaction steps typically used by the pharmaceutical industry featuring different characteristic reaction times, as well as L-L separation and distillation-based solvent exchange steps, and thus constitutes a good example of how the design framework can be useful to efficiently design novel or already existing API manufacturing processes taking advantage of continuous processes.

These special substructures are often referred to as toxicity alerts, toxicophores, or biophores. They are the main building blocks/classifying units of the model, and it is important to define the chemical structural space within which the alerts are expected to produce reliable predictions. Furthermore, defining an appropriate applicability domain is required as part of the OECD guidelines for the validation of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). In this respect, this paper describes a method to construct applicability domains for individual toxicity alerts that are part of the CASE Ultra expert system models. Defining applicability domain for individual alerts was necessary because each CASE Ultra model is comprised of multiple alerts, and different alerts of a model usually represent different toxicity mechanisms and cover different structural space; the use of an applicability domain for the overall model is often not adequate. The domain for each alert was constructed using a set of fragments that were found to be statistically related to the end point in question as opposed to using overall structural similarity or physicochemical properties. Use of the applicability domains in reducing false positive predictions is demonstrated. It is now possible to obtain ROC (receiver operating characteristic) profiles of CASE Ultra models by applying domain adherence cutoffs on the alerts identified in test chemicals. This helps in optimizing the performance of a model based on their true positive-false positive prediction trade-offs and reduce drastic effects on the predictive performance caused by the active/inactive ratio of the model's training set. None of the major currently available commercial expert systems for toxicity prediction offer the possibility to explore a model's full range of sensitivity-specificity spectrum, and therefore, the methodology developed in this study can be of benefit in improving the predictive ability of the alert based expert systems.","[Chakravarti, Suman K.; Saiakhov, Roustem D.; Klopman, Gilles] Multicase Inc, Beachwood, OH 44122 USA; [Klopman, Gilles] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Chakravarti, SK (reprint author), Multicase Inc, 23811 Chagrin Blvd,Suite 305, Beachwood, OH 44122 USA.",chakravarti@multicase.com,,,,,"LIJINSKY W, 1974, CANCER RES, V34, P255; Marchant CA, 2009, CHEM BIODIVERS, V6, P2107, DOI 10.1002/cbdv.200900133; KLOPMAN G, 1992, QUANT STRUCT-ACT REL, V11, P176, DOI 10.1002/qsar.19920110208; Greene N, 2002, ADV DRUG DELIVER REV, V54, P417, DOI 10.1016/S0169-409X(02)00012-1; Japertas P, 2002, QUANT STRUCT-ACT REL, V21, P23, DOI 10.1002/1521-3838(200205)21:1<23::AID-QSAR23>3.0.CO;2-E; [Anonymous], 2012, CASETOX VERSION 2 4; Sutherland JJ, 2008, J MED CHEM, V51, P2689, DOI 10.1021/jm701399f; Matthews EJ, 2006, REGUL TOXICOL PHARM, V44, P97, DOI 10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.10.004; Helma C, 2006, MOL DIVERS, V10, P147, DOI 10.1007/s11030-005-9001-5; Mahadevan B, 2011, ENVIRON MOL MUTAGEN, V52, P339, DOI 10.1002/em.20653; Gramatica P, 2007, QSAR COMB SCI, V26, P694, DOI 10.1002/qsar.200610151; Netzeva TI, 2005, ATLA-ALTERN LAB ANIM, V33, P155; Fawcett T, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V27, P861, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2005.10.010; Dearden JC, 2003, J COMPUT AID MOL DES, V17, P119, DOI 10.1023/A:1025361621494; Matthews EJ, 2007, REGUL TOXICOL PHARM, V47, P136, DOI 10.1016/j.yrtph.2006.10.001; Ellison CM, 2011, J CHEM INF MODEL, V51, P975, DOI 10.1021/ci1000967; Kazius J, 2005, J MED CHEM, V48, P312, DOI 10.1021/jm040835a; Matthews EJ, 2006, REGUL TOXICOL PHARM, V44, P83, DOI 10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.11.003; KLOPMAN G, 1984, J AM CHEM SOC, V106, P7315, DOI 10.1021/ja00336a004; Hansen K, 2009, J CHEM INF MODEL, V49, P2077, DOI 10.1021/ci900161g; [Anonymous], 2007, DEREK FOR WINDOWS VE; Saiakhov RD, 2010, J CHEM INF MODEL, V50, P1521, DOI 10.1021/ci1000899; SHANNON CE, 1948, AT&T TECH J, V27, P623; Kruhlak NL, 2012, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V91, P529, DOI 10.1038/clpt.2011.300; Cross KP, 2003, J MED CHEM, V46, P4770, DOI 10.1021/jm0302703; Dearden JC, 1997, ATLA-ALTERN LAB ANIM, V25, P223; Grant SG, 2000, MUTAT RES-GEN TOX EN, V465, P201, DOI 10.1016/S1383-5718(99)00186-2; Klopman G, 2003, CHEMOSPHERE, V51, P445, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00859-7; Klopman G., 2004, J CHEM INF COMP SCI, V41, P671; Klopman G, 2003, CHEMOSPHERE, V51, P461, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00858-5; Matthews EJ, 2007, REGUL TOXICOL PHARM, V47, P115, DOI 10.1016/j.yrtph.2006.11.002; Nikolova N., 2003, QSAR COMB SCI, V22, P1006, DOI DOI 10.1002/QSAR.200330831; Nikolova-Jeliazkova N, 2005, ATLA-ALTERN LAB ANIM, V33, P461",33,8,9,4,10,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.

This paper discusses these challenges with a focus on empirical land system studies, land system modelling and the analysis of future visions of land system change. Contemporary landscapes are contingent outcomes of past and present patterns, processes and decisions. Thus, empirical analysis of past and present land-use change has an important role in providing insights into the socio-economic and ecological processes that shape land use transitions. This is especially important with respect to gradual versus rapid land system dynamics and in understanding changes in land use intensity. Combining the strengths of empirical analysis with multi-scale modelling will lead to new insights into the processes driving land system change. New modelling methods that combine complex systems thinking at a local level with macro-level economic analysis of the land system would reconcile the multi-scale dynamics currently encapsulated in bottom-up and top-down modelling approaches. Developments in land use futures analysis could focus on integrating explorative scenarios that reflect possible outcomes with normative visions that identify desired outcomes. Such an approach would benefit from the broad and in-depth involvement of stakeholders in order to link scientific findings to political and societal decision-making culminating in a set of key choices and consequences. Land system models have an important role in supporting future land use policy, but model outputs require scientific interpretation rather than being presented as predictions. The future of land system science is strongly dependent on the research community's capacity to bring together the elements of research discussed in the paper, via empirical data collection and analysis of observed processes, computer simulation across scale levels and futures analysis of alternative, normative visions through stakeholder engagement.

Increasing urbanization of human societies combined with intense energy demands of modern economies have driven a recognition that sustainable practices require a systems approach to both the study and application of sustainability principles. Urban metabolism has emerged as a leading methodology for quantifying energy consumption and use patterns in urban environments. Though typically applied as a method of accounting for total energy and materials inputs and outputs into cities, its interdisciplinary history and methods allow urban metabolism to be expanded in ways that will allow more comprehensive and integrated assessment of the patterns and processes of urban energy systems. In this article, we review the concept of urban metabolism-including its two typical approaches: mass balance and ""emergy"" methods-and offer a means to expand urban metabolism into a platform that incorporates socioeconomic analysis, policy analysis, and additional quantitative methodologies (such as life cycle assessment). This expanded urban metabolism framework is more comprehensive analytically and builds upon the documented capacity of traditional urban metabolism to account for total energy and materials flows of cities to provide an integrated platform for analysis of both energy patterns and the causal processes that govern energy in contemporary cities.

Cognitive systems engineering (CSE) enables us to understand work domains, reveal expertise, and derive essential features for systems. This is valuable because the demand for rapidly evolving systems such as information and communication technology does not allow for long-term deliberation by system developers. The publication of work by Norman, Hollnagel and Woods, and Rasmussen in the early 1980s provides an opportunity to consider where CSE stands nearly 30 years since its inception. The papers in this special issue of Cognition, Technology and Work convey insights from authors who have substantial firsthand experience with the use of CSE to study human adaptation to changing, uncertain work settings. Their research demonstrates the current state of CSE, the potential for CSE to reveal how people adapt to change and uncertainty, and implications for the design of complex adaptive systems.","Appl Res Associates Inc, Fairborn, OH USA","Nemeth, CP (reprint author), Appl Res Associates Inc, Fairborn, OH USA.",cnemeth@ara.com,,,,,"Xiao Y, 2001, ECSCW 2001: PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK, P259; Carroll JS, 2006, ORGAN STUD, V27, P1037, DOI 10.1177/0170840606065709; Nemeth CP, 2004, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V34, P689, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2004.836802; Nemeth C, 2006, ORGAN STUD, V27, P1011, DOI 10.1177/0170840606065708; Roth EM, 2006, ORGAN STUD, V27, P967, DOI 10.1177/0170840606065705; Blumer H., 1969, SYMBOLIC INTERACTION; Cook R.

The research herein clarifies the effects of human behaviors, time delays, inaccurate expectations of cost growth behavior and other factors, offering improved conceptualization of the impact of abstract variables on cost growth. Methods of research include analysis of numerical data, statistical findings by research and development groups (RAND), Department of Defense system acquisition reports, and application of the developed model to a relevant program. A systems thinking approach to cost growth behavior analysis provides decision-makers with a holistic understanding of cause, effect and reaction in order to more realistically estimate cost growth. This paper provides a foundation for such an approach.","[Assidmi, Luay; Sarkani, Shahram; Mazzuchi, Thomas] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20037 USA","Assidmi, L (reprint author), George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",luay@gwu.edu; sarkani@gwu.edu; mazzuchi@gwu.edu,,,,,"Ford A, 2005, SYST DYNAM REV, V21, P273, DOI 10.1002/sdr.322; Ford DN, 1998, SYST DYNAM REV, V14, P31, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199821)14:1<31::AID-SDR141>3.0.CO;2-5; Doyle JK, 1998, SYST DYNAM REV, V14, P3, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199821)14:1<3::AID-SDR140>3.0.CO;2-K; Richardson GP, 1986, SYST DYNAM REV, V2, P158, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260020207; MAKRIDAKIS S, 1993, INT J FORECASTING, V9, P5, DOI 10.1016/0169-2070(93)90044-N; Davidsen PI, 1990, SYST DYNAM REV, V6, P66, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260060105; Arena M.V., 2006, HIST COST GROWTH COM; Bellinger G., 2004, SYSTEMS THINKING SYS; Bolten J.

In this paper, we develop a model for the mobile disk drive to numerically investigate the dynamics of the head-disk interface (HDI) during an operational shock. The results show that the disk and its support system design have a strong influence on the shock resistance.

Due to the dynamic nature and complexity of OHS management, the concept of system dynamics (SD) is used to analyze accident prevention. In this paper, a system dynamics group model building (GMB) approach is used to create a causal loop diagram of the underlying factors influencing the OHS performance of a major drilling and mining contractor in Australia. While the organization has invested considerable resources into OHS their disabling injury frequency rate (DIFR) has not been decreasing. With this in mind, rich individualistic knowledge about the dynamics influencing the DIFR was acquired from experienced employees with operations, health and safety and training background using a GMB workshop. Findings derived from the workshop were used to develop a series of causal loop diagrams that includes a wide range of dynamics that can assist in better understanding the causal influences OHS performance. The causal loop diagram provides a tool for organizations to hypothesize the dynamics influencing effectiveness of OHS management, particularly the impact on DIFR. In addition the paper demonstrates that the SD GMB approach has significant potential in understanding and improving OHS management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it tracks the evolution of our current perception and conceptual modelling of public health systems and the emerging recognition of the need for a whole systems approach. It gives examples of how methods of operational research, particularly those derivative of problem structuring methods, have been used to assist in clarifying the nature of the complexities that surround public health systems, identifying key change agents within public health systems, supporting these agents in making a meaningful contribution, and thereby planning and implementing effective interventions. These examples are drawn from work conducted within the public health systems of both developed and developing countries highlighting the importance of viewing the transfer of 'soft systems' technology as a two-way street with developed nations having (at least) as much to learn from their developing counterparts as they have to teach.","[Thunhurst, Colin] Crossing Cottage, Clifford HR3 5EX, Hereford, England; [Thunhurst, Colin] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Thunhurst, C (reprint author), Crossing Cottage, Clifford HR3 5EX, Hereford, England.",ColinThunhurst@compuserve.com,,,,,"Annett H, 1995, GUIDELINES RAPID PAR; Ben-Shlomo Y, 2002, INT J EPIDEMIOL, V31, P285, DOI 10.1093/ije/31.2.285; Royston G, 2011, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V89, P683, DOI 10.2471/BLT.11.086066; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Barton H, 2006, J R SOC PROMO HEALTH, V126, P252, DOI 10.1177/1466424006070466; Bormstein C, 2009, J OPER RES SOC, V60, P587; Bryant J, 1994, COMMUNITY OPERATIONA, V1; BUTLAND B., 2007, FORESIGHT TACKLING O; Crowley D., 2003, HLTH ENV EFFECTS LAN; CSDH, 2008, CLOS GAP GEN HLTH EQ; Dahlgren G, 1991, POLICIES STRATEGIES; Eden C., 2001, RATIONAL ANAL PROBLE; Friend J., 2001, RATIONAL ANAL PROBLE; Kuh D., 2004, LIFE COURSE APPROACH; Marmot M., 2010, FAIR SOC HLTH LIVES; Nancholas S, 1998, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V13, P189, DOI 10.1093/heapol/13.2.189; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2010, PREV OB US WHOL SYST; Pratt J., 1999, WORKING WHOLE SYSTEM; Rosenhead J, 2001, RATIONAL ANAL PROBLE; Suba EJ, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P480, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2004.061606; Taket A, 2000, PARTNERSHIP PARTICIP; Thunhurst C, 1996, OPERATIONAL RES DEV, P157; Thunhurst C., 2003, International Transactions in Operational Research, V10, DOI 10.1111/1475-3995.00414; Thunhurst C, 1992, J MANAGEMENT MED, V6, P56, DOI 10.1108/02689239210021979; Thunhurst C, 1999, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V14, P127, DOI 10.1093/heapol/14.2.127; Thunhurst C, 2007, OPERATIONAL RESEARCH FOR HEALTH POLICY: MAKING BETTER DECISIONS, P23; Townsend P., 1982, INEQUALITIES HLTH BL; Vandennbroeck P, 2007, FORESIGHT TACKLING O; Walt G, 1981, ROSS PUBLICATIONS, V13",29,1,1,2,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1386-9620,,,HEALTH CARE MANAG SC,Health Care Manag.

Rate of vocalizations is greatest at the end of their 1st week and beginning of the 2nd week, declines in the 2nd week as eyes open and thermoregulation becomes fully established, and ceases in the 3rd week. Young of 1 vole species, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), vocalize significantly more than those of other species, which has been attributed to the social structure of the species, because they have monogamous mating behavior and high level of biparental care. To determine whether this vocalizing behavior is typical of vole species with monogamous social systems, I examined calling behavior in another monogamous species with biparental care, the pine (or woodland) vole (M. pinetorum), and I compared it to that of a polygynous species that has only maternal care, the meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus). Pups were isolated for 20 min at 22 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and the number of ultrasonic calls they emitted was monitored. Pine vole pups vocalized at high rates, similar to prairie voles, emitting a mean of 47 calls/min at the ages when calling was greatest (8-16 days). In contrast, meadow vole pups vocalized significantly less, emitting a mean of 9 calls/min at the age of greatest calling (5-9 days). Pine voles continued vocalizing to 23 days, like prairie voles but different from other vole species, including meadow voles, which cease calling earlier. I conclude that young voles of monogamous species, which are highly affiliative and have paternal as well as maternal care, respond to the stress of isolation more strongly than do other vole species and emit more ultrasonic vocalizations than species that are less social and have less parental care.","[Blake, Barbara H.] Bennett Coll, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA; [Blake, Barbara H.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA","Blake, BH (reprint author), Bennett Coll, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA.",bhblake@uncg.edu,,,Minority Biomedical Research Support program from MORE division of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of National Institutes of Health [GM44780],"The following students provided invaluable help in taking data and caring for the vole colonies: K.

This article reviews risk factors associated with bullying and peer victimization in school within the context of Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework. This review integrates empirical findings on the risk factors associated with bullying and peer victimization within the context of micro- (parent-youth relationships, inter-parental violence, relations with peers, school connectedness, and school environment), meso- (teacher involvement), exo- (exposure to media violence, neighborhood environment), macro- (cultural norms and beliefs, religious affiliation), and chronosystem (changes in family structure) levels. Theories that explain the relationships between the risk factors and bullying behavior are also included. We then discuss the efficacy of the current bullying prevention and intervention programs, which is followed by directions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Barriers to energy efficiency have been widely studied but to our knowledge, except for a few studies, we found inadequate consideration for barrier-barrier interactions when proposing policy measures for improving energy efficiency. Leveraging systems thinking's power as a problem solver which identifies underlying structure that explains (similar) patterns of behavior in a variety of different situations, we attempted to identify patterns of barriers to adoption of energy efficiency measures in industrial companies. Inspired by systems thinking, the proposed framework has four stages, namely, Motivation, Capability, Implementation and Results, as well as a feedback loop. Using a case study, we show that following the four stages will lead to positive feedback for future energy efficiency implementations. The framework highlights the interconnected nature of the barriers and a need for policymakers to address these barriers in a holistic manner. We argue that the overall effectiveness of energy efficiency policies is only as strong as the weakest link in the four-stage framework. This differs from most prior research that addressed barriers in isolation, where a solution is proposed for each of the barriers without considering the relationship between the barriers. Our framework also offers a way to understand the roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders such as governments and energy service companies (ESCOs) in driving energy efficiency. This allows the assessment and identification of weak links in energy efficiency policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this problem, systems thinking seeks to understand interactions among the subsystems driving a system's overall behavior. System dynamics, a method for operationalizing systems thinking, facilitates holistic understanding of water resources systems, and strategic decision making. The approach also facilitates participatory modeling, and analysis of the system's behavioral trends, essential to sustainable management. The field of water resources has not utilized the full capacity of system dynamics in the thinking phase of integrated water resources studies. We advocate that the thinking phase of modeling applications is critically important, and that system dynamics offers unique qualitative tools that improve understanding of complex problems. Thus, this paper describes the utility of system dynamics for holistic water resources planning and management by illustrating the fundamentals of the approach. Using tangible examples, we provide an overview of Causal Loop and Stock and Flow Diagrams, reference modes of dynamic behavior, and system archetypes to demonstrate the use of these qualitative tools for holistic conceptualization of water resources problems.

An important goal is to elucidate the scope and mechanisms of endothelial heterogeneity and to use this information to develop vascular bed-specific therapies. We reexamine our current understanding of the molecular basis of endothelial heterogeneity. We introduce multistability as a new explanatory framework in vascular biology. We draw on the field of nonlinear dynamics to propose a dynamical systems framework for modeling multistability and its derivative properties, including robustness, memory, and plasticity. Our perspective allows for both a conceptual and quantitative description of system-level features of endothelial regulation.

The combination of increased consumer demand and diminished resources makes organizational planning a challenge for the managers of such organizations. Such challenges are confounded by significant demands for the optimization of resources and the goal to reduce expenses and to more effectively and efficiently use existing resources while at the same time providing high quality services. The authors explore the possibilities of using system dynamics modelling in organizational decision-making processes related to resource allocations. System dynamics suggests the application of generic systems archetypes as a first step in interpreting complex situations in an organization. The authors illustrate the application of this method via a case study in one provider organization in the Netherlands. The authors contend that such a modeling approach can be used by the management of similar organizations serving people with ID as a tool to support decision making that can result in optimal resource allocation.,"[Duryan, Meri; Curfs, Leopold] Univ Maastricht, Gouverneur Kremers Ctr, NL-6229 HA Maastricht, Netherlands; [Nikolik, Dragan] Maastricht Sch Management, Maastricht, Netherlands; [van Merode, Godefridus; Curfs, Leopold] Univ Maastricht, Med Ctr, NL-6229 HA Maastricht, Netherlands","Duryan, M (reprint author), Univ Maastricht, Gouverneur Kremers Ctr, Peter Debeyepl 1,Room B2-076, NL-6229 HA Maastricht, Netherlands.",meri.duryan@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,"Akcali Elif, 2006, Health Care Manag Sci, V9, P391, DOI 10.1007/s10729-006-0002-4; HIRSCH G, 1974, MED CARE, V12, P668, DOI 10.1097/00005650-197408000-00005; Harper PR, 2003, OR SPECTRUM, V25, P207, DOI 10.1007/s00291-003-0122-x; Polder JJ, 2002, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V46, P168, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2788.2002.00384.x; Sundaramoorthi D, 2010, HEALTH CARE MANAG SC, V13, P210, DOI 10.1007/s10729-009-9124-9; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; FORRESTER JW, 1980, J AM STAT ASSOC, V75, P555, DOI 10.2307/2287644; Schuengel C, 2010, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V54, P38, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01236.x; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; Wolstenholme E, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P341, DOI 10.1002/sdr.302; Jansen DEMC, 2004, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V48, P93, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2004.00483.x; De Schipper JC, 2010, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V54, P584, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2010.01288.x; Lane DC, 2000, J OPER RES SOC, V51, P518, DOI 10.2307/254183; Sundaramoorthi D, 2009, HEALTH CARE MANAG SC, V12, P252, DOI 10.1007/s10729-008-9090-7; Braun W., 2002, SYSTEMS ARCHETYPES; Carter M, 2002, ORMS TODAY, V29, P26; Checkland P.

Unit operation with known treatment efficiencies, flow pattern identification, and system dynamics modeling was cohesively concatenated in order to prove the concept of a newly developed media filter. A multicompartmental model addressing system dynamics and feedbacks based on our assumed microbiological processes accounting for aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic conditions in the media filter was constructed and calibrated with the aid of in situ measurements and the understanding of the flow patterns. Such a calibrated system dynamics model was then applied for a sensitivity analysis under changing inflow conditions based on the rates of nitrification and denitrification characterized through the field-scale testing. This advancement may contribute to design such a drainfield media filter in household septic tank systems in the future.","[Xuan, Zhemin; Chang, Ni-Bin; Wanielista, Martin] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Chang, NB (reprint author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",nchang@mail.ucf.edu,"Xuan, Zhemin /I-9449-2012",,"Bureau of Watershed Restoration, Florida Department of Environmental Protection","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by an Urban Nonpoint Source Research Grant from the Bureau of Watershed Restoration, Florida Department of Environmental Protection.","Guo HC, 2001, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V61, P93, DOI 10.1006/jema.2000.0400; Chang NB, 2010, ENVIRON ENG SCI, V27, P707, DOI 10.1089/ees.2010.0229; Beran B, 2005, ECOL MODEL, V181, P39, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.06.022; Elmahdi A., 2007, Environmentalist, V27, P3, DOI 10.1007/s10669-007-9010-2; Vezjak M, 1998, EUR J OPER RES, V109, P442, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(98)00069-1; Xuan ZM, 2010, ENVIRON ENG SCI, V27, P879, DOI 10.1089/ees.2010.0126; Chang NB, 2010, ENVIRON ENG SCI, V27, P469, DOI 10.1089/ees.2009.0387; Wood TS, 1999, ECOL ENG, V12, P231, DOI 10.1016/S0925-8574(98)00069-X; Abbott MD, 1999, SYST DYNAM REV, V15, P163, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199922)15:2<163::AID-SDR165>3.0.CO;2-N; Dyson B, 2005, WASTE MANAGE, V25, P669, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2004.10.005; VIZAYAKUMAR K, 1993, J ENVIRON SYST, V22, P59; Chang NB, 2011, ON SITE SEWAGE TREAT; Chang NB, 2010, ENVIRON ENG SCI, V27, P689, DOI 10.1089/ees.2009.0415; Chang NB, 2010, ENVIRON ENG SCI, V28, P11; Deaton M.

The intention is to reduce complications and associated costs, while improving the quality of care by mandating VTE prophylaxis. We applied a system dynamics model to estimate the impact of HACS on VTE rates, and potential unintended consequences such as increased rates of bleeding and infection and decreased access for patients who might benefit from TKA. Methods and Findings: The system dynamics model uses a series of patient stocks including the number needing TKA, deemed ineligible, receiving TKA, and harmed due to surgical complication. The flow of patients between stocks is determined by a series of causal elements such as rates of exclusion, surgery and complications. The number of patients harmed due to VTE, bleeding or exclusion were modeled by year by comparing patient stocks that results in scenarios with and without HACS. The percentage of TKA patients experiencing VTE decreased approximately 3-fold with HACS. This decrease in VTE was offset by an increased rate of bleeding and infection. Moreover, results from the model suggest HACS could exclude 1.5% or half a million patients who might benefit from knee replacement through 2020. Conclusion: System dynamics modeling indicates HACS will have the intended consequence of reducing VTE rates. However, an unintended consequence of the policy might be increased potential harm resulting from over administration of prophylaxis, as well as exclusion of a large population of patients who might benefit from TKA.","[Takemoto, Steven; Vail, Thomas P.] Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA USA; [Worni, Mathias; Pietrobon, Ricardo] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Zammar, Guilherme Roberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Takemoto, Steven] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orthopaed Surg, San Francisco, CA USA; [Worni, Mathias; Pietrobon, Ricardo; Zammar, Guilherme Roberto; Shah, Jatin; Maldonato, Mauro] Duke Univ, Dept Surg, Res Res Grp, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Yoo, Bryan] Stanford Univ, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Maldonato, Mauro] Univ Basilicata, Dept Stor Linguist & Antropol Sci, I-85100 Potenza, Italy","Vail, TP (reprint author), Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA USA.",vailt@orthosurg.ucsf.edu,,,,,"Fry DE, 2010, ARCH SURG-CHICAGO, V145, P148, DOI 10.1001/archsurg.2009.277; NormanTaylor FH, 1996, J BONE JOINT SURG BR, V78B, P74; ANDERSON FA, 1991, ARCH INTERN MED, V151, P933, DOI 10.1001/archinte.151.5.933; Rogers SO, 2007, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V204, P1211, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.02.072; [Anonymous], 2008, SURG GEN CALL ACT PR; Whitehouse JD, 2002, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V23, P183, DOI 10.1086/502033; Nutescu EA, 2008, ANN PHARMACOTHER, V42, P1216, DOI 10.1345/aph.1L135; Sorensen HT, 2007, LANCET, V370, P1773; Kakkar AK, 2010, ANN SURG, V251, P330, DOI [10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181c0e58f, 10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181c0c58f]; Cushman M, 2004, AM J MED, V117, P19, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.01.018; Cohen AT, 2008, LANCET, V371, P387, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60202-0; Duska LR, 2010, GYNECOL ONCOL, V116, P374, DOI [10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.10.069, 10.1016/j,ygyno.2009.10.069]; Millett C, 2008, ANN FAM MED, V6, P490, DOI 10.1370/afm.907; Goldhaber SZ, 2004, AM J CARDIOL, V93, P259, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2003.09.057; Losina E, 2009, ARCH INTERN MED, V169, P1113, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.136; Galat DD, 2008, J BONE JOINT SURG AM, V90A, P2331, DOI 10.2106/JBJS.G.01370; Patel VP, 2007, J BONE JOINT SURG AM, V89A, P33, DOI 10.2106/JBJS.F.00163; Brown J, 2009, CLIN INFECT DIS, V49, P743, DOI 10.1086/604719; Johanson NA, 2009, J AM ACAD ORTHOP SUR, V17, P183; Millett C, 2009, DIABETES CARE, V32, P404, DOI 10.2337/dc08-0912; Hawker GA, 2004, ARTHRIT RHEUM-ARTHR, V51, P635, DOI 10.1002/art.20524; Jordan JM, 2007, J RHEUMATOL, V34, P172, DOI 10.3899/jrheum.080677; White RH, 2000, NEW ENGL J MED, V343, P1758, DOI 10.1056/NEJM200012143432403; Durieux P, 2000, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V283, P2816, DOI 10.1001/jama.283.21.2816; Pronovost PJ, 2008, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V299, P2197, DOI 10.1001/jama.299.18.2197; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; Kahn SR, 2007, THROMB RES, V119, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2006.01.011; Tooher R, 2005, ANN SURG, V241, P397, DOI 10.1097/01.sla.0000154120.96169.99; Abrams DB, 2010, AM J PREV MED, V38, pS351, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.12.011; Heit JA, 2006, J THROMB THROMBOLYS, V21, P23, DOI 10.1007/s11239-006-5572-y; Werner RM, 2005, CIRCULATION, V111, P1257, DOI 10.1116/01.CIR.000157729.59754.09; Shah J, 2009, ACAD MED, V84, P511, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31819a8c3c; Piazza G, 2009, CIRCULATION, V119, P2196, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.841197; McDonald R, 2009, J HEALTH POLIT POLIC, V34, P747, DOI 10.1215/03616878-2009-024; Heit JA, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P1245, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.11.1245; Rasanen P, 2007, ACTA ORTHOP, V78, P108, DOI 10.1080/17453670610013501; Saleh K, 2002, J ORTHOPAED RES, V20, P506, DOI 10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00153-X; Turpie AGG, 2009, LANCET, V373, P1673, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60734-0; Rosenthal MB, 2007, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V297, P740, DOI 10.1001/jama.297.7.740; Ballal RD, 2008, CURR MED RES OPIN, V24, P753, DOI 10.1185/030079908X273048; Bozzette SA, 2003, NEW ENGL J MED, V348, P416, DOI 10.1056/NEJMsa025075; Byrne GJ, 1996, BRIT MED J, V313, P917; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The model was developed to estimate the performance parameters of RO in a multiple membrane elements pressure vessel. For simplicity the results of this study were compared with Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA) software which was assumed to have acceptable marginal errors. Two different feed water (NaCl) concentrations 35,000 mg/L and 38,000 mg/L were investigated in this study. In this paper, the recovery rate, salt rejection, feed pressure and permeate concentration of each RO element in the pressure vessel was compared with ROSA as shown in figures 2 to 5. The results from this study showed a very good agreement with ROSA up to 95%. Most of the previous studies were focused on studying the performance of a single RO membrane. This study, probably, the first to present a systematic procedure for estimating the performance of multiple RO elements in a pressure vessel. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We use the dynamical systems approach to study the qualitative behavior of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies where the cosmological constant is dynamically evolving according with this nonperturbative scaling at low energies. It will be shown that it is possible to realize 'two regimes' dark energy phases, where an unstable early phase of power-law evolution of the scale factor is followed by an accelerated expansion era at late times.","[Bonanno, Alfio] INAF, Osservatorio Astrofis Catania, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Bonanno, Alfio] INAF, Sez Catania, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Carloni, Sante] ESA Adv Concept Team, European Space Res Technol Ctr ESTEC, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands","Bonanno, A (reprint author), INAF, Osservatorio Astrofis Catania, Via S Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",alfio.bonanno@inaf.it,"Carloni, Sante/J-2840-2013; ","Carloni, Sante/0000-0003-2373-2653; Bonanno, Alfio/0000-0003-3175-9776",,,"Abdelwahab M, 2008, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V25, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/25/13/135002; Alexandre J, 1999, PHYS LETT B, V445, P351, DOI 10.1016/S0370-2693(98)01491-9; Manrique E, 2011, ANN PHYS-NEW YORK, V326, P463, DOI 10.1016/j.aop.2010.11.006; Reuter M, 1998, PHYS REV D, V57, P971, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.57.971; Carloni S, 2010, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V27, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/27/4/045004; Souma W, 1999, PROG THEOR PHYS, V102, P181, DOI 10.1143/PTP.102.181; Percacci R, 2003, PHYS REV D, V67, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.67.081503; Bonanno A, 2004, INT J MOD PHYS D, V13, P107, DOI 10.1142/S0218271804003809; Carloni S, 2006, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V23, P1913, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/23/6/006; Esposito G, 2007, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V24, P6255, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/24/24/008; Lima JAS, 1996, PHYS REV D, V54, P2571, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.54.2571; Reuter M, 2004, PHYS REV D, V70, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.70.124028; Carloni S, 2005, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V22, P4839, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/22/22/011; Dou D, 1998, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V15, P3449, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/15/11/011; Bonanno A, 2002, PHYS LETT B, V527, P9, DOI 10.1016/S0370-2693(01)01522-2; Bonanno A, 2002, PHYS REV D, V65, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508; Bonanno A, 1999, PHYS REV D, V60, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.60.084011; Reuter M, 2004, FORTSCHR PHYS, V52, P650, DOI 10.1002/prop.200310158; Copeland EJ, 2009, PHYS REV D, V79, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.79.103515; Carloni S, 2008, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V25, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/25/3/035008; Codello A, 2008, INT J MOD PHYS A, V23, P143, DOI 10.1142/S0217751X08038135; Reuter M, 2009, PHYS REV D, V79, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.79.105005; Reuter M, 2004, PHYS REV D, V69, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.69.104022; Lauscher O, 2002, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V19, P483, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/19/3/304; Leach JA, 2006, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V23, P4915, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/23/15/011; Benedetti D, 2010, NUCL PHYS B, V824, P168, DOI 10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2009.08.023; Copeland EJ, 1998, PHYS REV D, V57, P4686, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.57.4686; Bonanno A, 2000, PHYS REV D, V62, part. no., DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.62.043008; Carloni S, 2009, GEN RELAT GRAVIT, V41, P1757, DOI 10.1007/s10714-008-0747-9; Reuter M, 2002, PHYS REV D, V66, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.66.125001; Codello A, 2009, ANN PHYS-NEW YORK, V324, P414, DOI 10.1016/j.aop.2008.08.008; Codello A, 2006, PHYS REV LETT, V97, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.221301; Reuter M, 2009, GEN RELAT GRAVIT, V41, P983, DOI 10.1007/s10714-008-0744-z; Litim DF, 2004, PHYS REV LETT, V92, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.201301; Lauscher O, 2002, PHYS REV D, V65, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.025013; Benedetti D, 2009, AIP CONF PROC, V1196, P44, DOI 10.1063/1.3284399; Bentivegna E, 2004, J COSMOL ASTROPART P, DOI 10.1088/1475-7516/2004/01/001; Bogoyavlensky O.

Using dynamical system analysis, we show that a family of electro-vacuum plane-wave solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations is the stable attractor for expanding universes. Phase dynamics are investigated in detail for particular symmetric models. We integrate the system exactly for some special cases to confirm the qualitative features. Some of the obtained solutions have not been presented previously to the best of our knowledge. Finally, based on those analyses, we discuss the relation between those homogeneous models and perturbations of open Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universes. We argue that the electro-vacuum plane-wave modes correspond to a certain long-wavelength limit of electromagnetic perturbations.","Univ Cambridge, Ctr Math Sci, DAMTP, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England","Yamamoto, K (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Math Sci, DAMTP, Wilberforce Rd, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England.",K.Yamamoto@damtp.cam.ac.uk,,,Cambridge Overseas Trust,The author would like to thank Professor John D.

But it is often forgotten that Senge's 'system thinking' formulation of the learning organization was inseparable from an attempt to reformulate a new way of thinking about change agency and leadership in organizations. Here it is argued that Senge's learning organization can be re-conceptualised as a partial fusion of 'systems thinking' and learning theories that leads to a concept of organizational learning as a form of 'distributed leadership'. However, the concept is critically flawed because it cannot theorise the organizing practices by which learning to lead and leading to learn are shared or distributed in organizations. It is concluded that Senge's under-theorized focus on distributed leadership consistently neglects issues of practice and issues of power. As such his work does not provide an exploration of the possibilities for increasing the dispersal of human agency, power, knowledge and autonomy within the workplace.","Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England","Caldwell, R (reprint author), Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England.",R.Caldwell@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,"Ortenblad A, 2002, MANAGE LEARN, V33, P213, DOI 10.1177/1350507602332004; Contu A, 2003, HUM RELAT, V56, P931, DOI 10.1177/00187267030568002; Gronn P, 2002, LEADERSHIP QUART, V13, P423, DOI 10.1016/S1048-9843(02)00120-0; Blackler F, 2009, MANAGE LEARN, V40, P161, DOI 10.1177/1350507608101227; Elkjaer B, 2001, MANAGE LEARN, V32, P437, DOI 10.1177/1350507601324002; Geiger D, 2009, MANAGE LEARN, V40, P129, DOI 10.1177/1350507608101228; Orlikowski WJ, 1996, INFORM SYST RES, V7, P63, DOI 10.1287/isre.7.1.63; Driver M, 2002, HUM RELAT, V55, P33, DOI 10.1177/0018726702055001605; Berson Y, 2006, LEADERSHIP QUART, V17, P577, DOI 10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.10.003; Gherardi S, 2000, ORGANIZATION, V7, P211, DOI 10.1177/135050840072001; Raelin JA, 2007, ACAD MANAG LEARN EDU, V6, P495; Lynch M, 2000, THEOR CULT SOC, V17, P26, DOI 10.1177/02632760022051202; Wenger E, 2000, ORGANIZATION, V7, P225, DOI 10.1177/135050840072002; Argyris C, 2003, ORGAN STUD, V24, P1178, DOI 10.1177/01708406030247009; Weick KE, 1991, ORGAN SCI, V2, P116, DOI 10.1287/orsc.2.1.116; Simon HA, 1991, ORGAN SCI, V2, P125, DOI 10.1287/orsc.2.1.125; Caldwell R, 2005, HUM RELAT, V58, P83, DOI 10.1177/0018726705050937; EasterbySmith M, 1997, HUM RELAT, V50, P1085, DOI 10.1177/001872679705000903; Mazutis D, 2008, MANAGE LEARN, V39, P437, DOI 10.1177/1350507608093713; Burnes B, 2004, J MANAGE STUD, V41, P977, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2004.00463.x; Adams M, 2003, BRIT J SOCIOL, V54, P221, DOI 10.1080/0007131032000080212; SENGE PM, 1990, SLOAN MANAGE REV, V32, P7; Lane DC, 2000, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V17, P3, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1743(200001/02)17:1<3::AID-SRES344>3.0.CO;2-7; Johnson P, 2003, J MANAGE STUD, V40, P1279, DOI 10.1111/1467-6486.00380; Friedman VJ, 2005, J MANAGE INQUIRY, V14, P19, DOI 10.1177/1056492604273758; Wolstenholme EF, 2003, SYST DYNAM REV, V19, P7, DOI 10.1002/sdr.259; Senge PM, 2007, MIT SLOAN MANAGE REV, V48, P44; Tsoukas H, 2002, ORGAN SCI, V13, P567, DOI 10.1287/orsc.13.5.567.7810; Argyris C., 1978, ORG LEARNING THEORY; Argyris C, 2004, REASONS RATIONALIZAT; Armstrong H, 2000, ORGANIZATION, V7, P355, DOI 10.1177/135050840072010; BARKER JR, 1993, ADMIN SCI QUART, V38, P408, DOI 10.2307/2393374; Bass B.

This is from an ongoing study, involving the design of systems-oriented undergraduate courses at Izmir University. These courses are being designed to enrich the undergraduate education in engineering and social sciences in general, and technology management in particular. The first course in the sequence is Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, introducing basics of systems thinking and its application. The subject matter of this paper is the second and the third courses: Introduction to Dynamic Systems, and System Dynamics and Managing Complexity. The former is on the essentials of Systems Theory, covering both linear and nonlinear systems. This course establishes the theoretical and analytical grounds for the latter. The objectives of System Dynamics and Managing Complexity are designed to present a combination of quantitative and qualitative tools for modeling complex systems (industrial systems, socio-economic systems, ecological systems, etc.) and to teach the application of systems dynamics methodology. All three courses are offered to students of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering.

This paper describes an extension of Bill's work on surface scatter behavior and the application of the BRDF to practical optical engineering problems. Most currently-available image analysis codes require the BRDF data as input in order to calculate the image degradation from residual optical fabrication errors. This BRDF data is difficult to measure and rarely available for short EUV wavelengths of interest. Due to a smooth-surface approximation, the classical Rayleigh-Rice surface scatter theory cannot be used to calculate BRDFs from surface metrology data for even slightly rough surfaces. The classical Beckmann-Kirchhoff theory has a paraxial limitation and only provides a closed-form solution for Gaussian surfaces. Recognizing that surface scatter is a diffraction process, and by utilizing sound radiometric principles, we first developed a linear systems theory of non-paraxial scalar diffraction in which diffracted radiance is shift-invariant in direction cosine space. Since random rough surfaces are merely a superposition of sinusoidal phase gratings, it was a straightforward extension of this non-paraxial scalar diffraction theory to develop a unified surface scatter theory that is valid for moderately rough surfaces at arbitrary incident and scattered angles. Finally, the above two steps are combined to yield a linear systems approach to modeling image quality for systems suffering from a variety of image degradation mechanisms. A comparison of image quality predictions with experimental results taken from on-orbit Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) data is presented.","Univ Cent Florida, CREOL, Coll Opt & Photon, Orlando, FL 32826 USA","Harvey, JE (reprint author), Univ Cent Florida, CREOL, Coll Opt & Photon, POB 162700,4000 Cent Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32826 USA.",,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2010, FRED US MAN VERS 9 1; Harvey JE, 1999, APPL OPTICS, V38, P6469, DOI 10.1364/AO.38.006469; [Anonymous], 2002, TRACEPRO US MAN REL, P712; Harvey JE, 2006, J OPT SOC AM A, V23, P858, DOI 10.1364/JOSAA.23.000858; [Anonymous], 2007, ZEMAX US GUID VERS, P391; Krywonos A, 2011, J OPT SOC AM A, V28, P1121, DOI 10.1364/JOSAA.28.001121; [Anonymous], 1982, ISO STAND HDB, V2; Wood RW, 1902, PHILOS MAG, V4, P396; Harvey JE, 2007, OPT ENG, V46, DOI 10.1117/1.2752180; Harvey JE, 2000, APPL OPTICS, V39, P6374, DOI 10.1364/AO.39.006374; Harvey JE, 2006, OPT ENG, V45, DOI 10.1117/1.2209215; [Anonymous], 1987, US MAN APART PADE VE, P5; Beckmann P., 1963, SCATTERING ELECTROMA; Boyd E.

The knowledge gained from these experiments concerns the practical aspects of (a) governance in terms of policy effectiveness, (b) sustainability science in terms of applying transdisciplinary science to social-ecological problems, and (c) simulation analysis in terms of quantifying dysfunctions in complex systems. This new knowledge can help broaden our perspectives on how research can be changed to better serve society. The infusion of systems thinking into research and policy making leads to a preference for multi-issue instead of single-issue studies, an expansion from static to dynamic indicators, an understanding of the boundaries between system-dependent and system-independent problems, and the inclusion of non-market evaluations. It also develops a real partnership among research, management, and stakeholders to establish a quantitative basis for collaborative decision making. Furthermore, the article argues that the transition to sustainable development for coastal systems requires consideration of the scale interdependency from individual to global and recognition of the probable global reorganizational emergence of scale-free networks that could cooperate to maximize the integrated sustainability among them.","[Hopkins, Tom S.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hopkins, Tom S.] CNR Inst Coastal Marine Environm, Naples, Italy; [Bailly, Denis] Univ Brest, Brest, France; [Elmgren, Ragnar] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Glegg, Gillian] Plymouth Marine Stn, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Stottrup, Josianne G.] Danish Tech Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark","Hopkins, TS (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,"Elmgren, Ragnar/A-1854-2013",,"European Commission; Institute IFREMER, France; Institute IAMC, Italy; Institute UBO, France; SPICOSA Consortium","The authors wish to acknowledge the 6th FP of the European Commission (RTD Climate change and Ecosystems call) for its foresight and funding in the form of farsighted objectives to stimulate research toward the needs of the evolving EU community.

The application of systems engineering methodologies that integrate standalone, small-scale technologies and interface them with macro technologies to build useful systems is critical to realizing the potential of these technologies. This paper covers the expanding knowledge base on systems engineering principles for micro and nano technology integration starting with a discussion of the drivers for applying a systems approach. Technology development on the micro and nano scale has transition from laboratory curiosity to the realization of products in the health, automotive, aerospace, communication, and numerous other arenas. This paper focuses on the maturity (or lack thereof) of the field of nanosystems which is emerging in a third generation having transitioned from completing active structures to creating systems. The emphasis of applying a systems approach focuses on successful technology development based on the lack of maturity of current nano scale systems. Therefore the discussion includes details relating to enabling roles such as product systems engineering and technology development. Classical roles such as acquisition systems engineering are not covered. The results are also targeted towards small-scale technology developers who need to take into account systems engineering processes such as requirements definition, verification, and validation interface management and risk management in the concept phase of technology development to maximize the likelihood of success, cost effective micro and nano technology to increase the capability of emerging deployed systems and long-term growth and profits.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20729 USA","Darrin, MAG (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, 11100 Johns Hopkins Rd, Laurel, MD 20729 USA.",Ann.darrin@jhuapl.edu,"Darrin, Margaret/H-4305-2011",,,,"Ackhoff Russell, 1981, CREATING CORPORATE F; Allhoff F, 2010, WHAT IS NANOTECHNOLO; [Anonymous], 2001, SYSTEN ENG FUNDAMENT; [Anonymous], 2006, NTR; Ottino JM, 2004, NATURE, V427, P399, DOI 10.1038/427399a; [Anonymous], 2004, ACCELERATING TECHNOL; [Anonymous], 1990, COMP IEEE STAND COMP; [Anonymous], TOP DOWN VS BOTTON U; Baird Davis, 2004, NANOTECH CHALLENGE 1, V10, P83; Bar-Yam Yaneer, ENG COMPLEX SYSTEMS; INCOSE, 2007, INCOSETP200400402; International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), 2007, INCOSETP2003002031; Reductionism.

The disease is a result of mutation in ATP7B, which encodes the ATP7B copper transporting ATPase. Loss of copper transport function by ATP7B results in copper accumulation primarily in the liver, but also in other organs including the brain. Studies in the Atp7b(-/-) mouse model of WD revealed specific transcript and metabolic changes that precede development of liver pathology, most notably downregulation of transcripts in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of transcriptomic and metabolic changes, we used a systems approach analysing the pre-symptomatic hepatic nuclear proteome and liver metabolites. We found that ligand-activated nuclear receptors FXR/NR1H4 and GR/NR3C1 and nuclear receptor interacting partners are less abundant in Atp7b(-/-) hepatocyte nuclei, while DNA repair machinery and the nucleus-localized glutathione peroxidase, SelH, are more abundant. Analysis of metabolites revealed an increase in polyol sugar alcohols, indicating a change in osmotic potential that precedes hepatocyte swelling observed later in disease. This work is the first application of quantitative Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MuDPIT) to a model of WD to investigate protein-level mechanisms of WD pathology. The systems approach using ""shotgun"" proteomics and metabolomics in the context of previous transcriptomic data reveals molecular-level mechanisms of WD development and facilitates targeted analysis of hepatocellular copper toxicity.","[Short, Kristopher K.; Burkhead, Jason L.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Wilmarth, Phillip A.; David, Larry L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Fiehn, Oliver] Univ Calif Davis, Genome Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lutsenko, Svetlana] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Physiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Burkhead, JL (reprint author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",afjlb7@uaa.alaska.edu,"Burkhead, Jason/C-9612-2013","Burkhead, Jason/0000-0001-5457-311X","National Institutes of Health [P01 GM067166, 5P20RR016466-11 (7979), P20GM103395]","We thank Lawrence Gray and Abigael Muchen for assistance with animal handling and sample preparation.

This article focuses on the use of the System Dynamics Modelling approach to deal with these three problems, an approach first suggested by Forrester back in 1958. The wide scope of application of BSC as a decision-supporting instrument continues to spur the interest in BSC. We have used an actual case as inspiration on which our model construction and our simulation scenarios are based. Our findings suggest that the idea of linking BSC and System Dynamics together based on properties of the systems dynamic nature seem to be both a natural and a relevant development. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate the ability to: (1) provide a scheme for the translation of the strategy into operational terms and at the same time (2) offer possibilities for the decision maker to be able to evaluate the plan-do-review results based on the feedbacks, specifically in a risk evaluating context.","[Nielsen, Steen; Nielsen, Erland H.] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Business Studies, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark","Nielsen, S (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Business Studies, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark.",sni@asb.dk,,,,,"Malina MA, 2007, CONTEMP ACCOUNT RES, V24, P935, DOI 10.1506/car.24.3.10; Baines TS, 1999, PROD PLAN CONTROL, V10, P542, DOI 10.1080/095372899232830; [Anonymous], 2008, HARVARD BUS REV; Schwaninger M, 2008, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V25, P447, DOI 10.1002/sres.914; ARGYRIS C, 1991, HARVARD BUS REV, V69, P99; Merchant KA, 2003, ACCOUNT ORG SOC, V28, P251, DOI 10.1016/S0361-3682(01)00051-4; Maani KE, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P21, DOI 10.1002/sdr.281; De Geuser F, 2009, EUR ACCOUNT REV, V18, P93, DOI 10.1080/09638180802481698; ACKOFF RL, 1981, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V2, P353, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250020404; Ackoff RL, 2006, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V23, P705, DOI 10.1002/sres.791; Kaplan RS, 2007, HARVARD BUS REV, V85, P150; Neely A, 1997, INT J OPER PROD MAN, V17, P1131, DOI 10.1108/01443579710177888; KAPLAN RS, 1992, HARVARD BUS REV, V70, P71; EBERLEIN RL, 1992, EUR J OPER RES, V59, P216, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(92)90018-5; FORRESTER JW, 1958, HARVARD BUS REV, V36, P37; Akkermans HA, 2005, J OPER RES SOC, V56, P931, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601923; Sterman JD, 1997, MANAGE SCI, V43, P503, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.43.4.503; Wu DD, 2009, PROD PLAN CONTROL, V20, P362, DOI 10.1080/09537280902843706; Malmi T, 2008, MANAGE ACCOUNT RES, V19, P287, DOI 10.1016/j.mar.2008.09.003; Ittner CD, 2003, HARVARD BUS REV, V81, P88; Coyle G, 2000, SYST DYNAM REV, V16, P225, DOI 10.1002/1099-1727(200023)16:3<225::AID-SDR195>3.0.CO;2-D; Anthony R.

The paper concentrates on a systems thinking-based view to highlight the potentially endangered elements of a project, including its outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The paper gives a broad state of the art in Many scientific domains; a definition of project vulnerability; a description of a project vulnerability management process, including identification, analysis and response plan; and a test on an industrial case study. Findings - The author's project vulnerability management process permits one to concentrate directly on the existing weaknesses of a project system, which may create potential damages regarding the project values creation. By focusing on this system, response plans may be more adapted to the existing short comings of the project. Research limitations/implications - Some aspects of the vulnerability definition should be refined, like the concepts of susceptibility or cruciality. Other promising works may focus on the evaluation of the non-resistance and resilience, notably thanks to the introduction of interdependences which exist in complex projects. Practical implications - A case study was done on a decision support system (FabACT) developed at Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou Pharmacy department. The aim of this project was to achieve a better balance between the workload and the efficiency of the compounding unit. Originality/value - The paper presents an innovative way to analyse a project's vulnerability by focusing on its existing weaknesses using a systems thinking-based approach.","[Vidal, Ludovic-Alexandre; Marle, Franck] Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Genie Ind, Malabry, France","Marle, F (reprint author), Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Genie Ind, Malabry, France.",franck.marle@ecp.fr,,,,,"AFNOR, 2003, X50117 AFN3R FD; Dibben C, 1999, J VOLCANOL GEOTH RES, V92, P133, DOI 10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00072-4; Shi LY, 2001, SOC SCI MED, V53, P519, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00357-9; Bogataj D, 2007, INT J PROD ECON, V108, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2006.12.017; Luers AL, 2003, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V13, P255, DOI 10.1016/S0959-3780(03)00054-2; APM, 1996, PROJ RISK AN MAN PRA; Blaikie P, 1994, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS; BLAIKIE P.

It is particularly significant to explore the impacts of government interventions on the management practices of local communities and on target social-ecological systems. The Inner Mongolian rangeland was traditionally managed by indigenous people using their own institutions that were adapted to the highly variable local climate and were able to maintain the resilience of the social-ecological system for more than 1000 years. However, external interventions have significantly affected the rangeland social-ecological system in recent decades. In this paper, using livestock breed improvement as an example, we track government interventions from the traditional era through the collective period to the present market economy period based on a review of historical documents and case studies. Using the concept of social-ecological system resilience, we diagnose the impacts of interventions on livestock breed management in the rangeland social-ecological system, and discuss how these interventions occur. We found that government interventions in livestock breeding have gradually decoupled the pastoral society from its supporting ecological system. During this process, external powers have increasingly displaced the local community in defining the nature of rangeland management. Power asymmetry and discourse have contributed to this displacement.","[Li, Wenjun; Li, Yanbo] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Li, WJ (reprint author), Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [40871252]; Ford Foundation,"Research on this topic was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (40871252) and a Ford Foundation grant.

HFE has a unique combination of three fundamental characteristics: (1) it takes a systems approach (2) it is design driven and (3) it focuses on two closely related outcomes: performance and well-being. In order to contribute to future system design, HFE must demonstrate its value more successfully to the main stakeholders of system design. HFE already has a strong value proposition (mainly well-being) and interactivity with the stakeholder group of 'system actors' (employees and product/service users). However, the value proposition (mainly performance) and relationships with the stakeholder groups of 'system experts' (experts from technical and social sciences involved in system design), and 'system decision makers' (managers and other decision makers involved in system design, purchase, implementation and use), who have a strong power to influence system design, need to be developed. Therefore, the first main strategic direction is to strengthen the demand for high-quality HFE by increasing awareness among powerful stakeholders of the value of high-quality HFE by communicating with stakeholders, by building partnerships and by educating stakeholders. The second main strategic direction is to strengthen the application of high-quality HFE by promoting the education of HFE specialists, by ensuring high-quality standards of HFE applications and HFE specialists, and by promoting HFE research excellence at universities and other organisations. This strategy requires cooperation between the HFE community at large, consisting of the International Ergonomics Association (IEA), local (national and regional) HFE societies, and HFE specialists. We propose a joint world-wide HFE development plan, in which the IEA takes a leadership role. Practitioner Summary: Human factors/ergonomics (HFE) has much to offer by addressing major business and societal challenges regarding work and product/service systems. HFE potential, however, is underexploited. This paper presents a strategy for the HFE community to strengthen demand and application of high-quality HFE, emphasising its key elements: systems approach, design driven, and performance and well-being goals.","[Dul, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bruder, Ralph] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Ergon, Darmstadt, Germany; [Buckle, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Surg & Canc, Fac Med, London, England; [Carayon, Pascale] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Qual & Prod Improvement, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Falzon, Pierre] Cnam, Res Ctr Work & Dev, Paris, France; [Marras, William S.] Ohio State Univ, Biodynam Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wilson, John R.] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Human Factors Res Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [van der Doelen, Bas] BMA Ergon, Dept Knowledge & Commun, Zwolle, Netherlands","Dul, J (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",jdul@rsm.nl,"Dul, Jan/B-8524-2008",,International Ergonomics Association (IEA),"Furthermore, input was received from a group of 17 PhD candidates and professors of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers (CNAM), Paris, France.

These actuators are widely considered as transfer systems, which transfer magnitudes calculated via simulation of the numerical substructure to the physical substructure. Control engineering efforts in this area have, with few exceptions, traditionally been focused on compensation of the transfer system dynamics, in order to obtain perfect transfer systems. This article shows that the role of control systems in the context of real-time substructuring tests is not limited to transfer system dynamics compensation. Similarly, the role of actuators need not be that of transfer systems. As a result, a novel range of methods opens for actuator and control system design, which presents significant advantages over transfer systems with their corresponding dynamics compensation schemes.","Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Adv Control & Test Lab, Bristol, Avon, England","Elorza, I (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Adv Control & Test Lab, Bristol, Avon, England.",I.Elorza.Pinedo@gmail.com,,,,,"AKTAN HM, 1986, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V112, P183; Seki K, 2009, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V56, P628, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2008.2007536; Smith MC, 2002, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V47, P1648, DOI 10.1109/TAC.2002.803532; Pinto AV, 2004, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V33, P1125, DOI 10.1002/eqe.393; Horiuchi T, 1999, EARTHQUAKE ENG STRUC, V28, P1121, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9845(199910)28:10<1121::AID-EQE858>3.3.CO;2-F; Zhao J, 2003, EARTHQUAKE ENG STRUC, V32, P1773, DOI 10.1002/eqe.301; Pegon P, 2000, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V29, P905, DOI 10.1002/1096-9845(200007)29:7<905::AID-EQE941>3.0.CO;2-P; Wallace MI, 2005, P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY, V461, P3807, DOI 10.1098/rspa.2005.1532; Lim CN, 2007, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V133, P864, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:8(864); Chen C., 2010, SMART MATER STRUCT, V19, P1; Cheng Chen, 2010, Frontiers of Architecture and Civil Engineering in China, V4, DOI 10.1007/s11709-010-0072-8; Elorza I., 2011, THESIS U BRISTOL; Gawthrop PJ, 2007, STRUCT CONTROL HLTH, V14, P591, DOI 10.1002/stc.174; Landau Y.

The abstract nature of network metrics primes them for use in cross-comparisons of social systems, but more work is needed to determine how well such measures can approximate meaningful biological properties. Finding biological correlates of network metrics, and extending the existing network methods to include the analysis of ongoing dynamics of social processes, will bring us closer to standardization of the terminology used to describe animal social and interaction networks. This will allow us to use the social networks in simultaneously studying the individuals embedded in a social setting, the consequences of their interactions, and the global properties of the social system. We discuss how certain facets of the existing network methods need be further developed to fulfill this potential and provide a multi-scale systems approach to the studies of animal sociality.","[Hock, Karlo; Fefferman, Nina H.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Fefferman, Nina H.] Rutgers State Univ, DIMACS, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Hock, K (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",hock@aesop.rutgers.edu,,,,,"Meyers LA, 2005, J THEOR BIOL, V232, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.07.026; Flack JC, 2006, NATURE, V439, P426, DOI 10.1038/nature04326; Sih A, 2009, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V63, P975, DOI 10.1007/s00265-009-0725-6; Godfrey SS, 2009, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V63, P1045, DOI 10.1007/s00265-009-0730-9; McDonald DB, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P10910, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0701159104; Wittemyer G, 2005, ANIM BEHAV, V69, P1357, DOI 10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.08.018; Sih A, 2005, BEHAVIOUR, V142, P1417, DOI 10.1163/156853905774539454; De Vries H, 1998, ANIM BEHAV, V55, P827, DOI 10.1006/anbe.1997.0708; Wolf JBW, 2007, ANIM BEHAV, V74, P1293, DOI 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.02.024; Wey T, 2008, ANIM BEHAV, V75, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.06.020; Madden JR, 2009, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V64, P81, DOI 10.1007/s00265-009-0820-8; Lusseau D, 2007, EVOL ECOL, V21, P357, DOI 10.1007/s10682-006-9105-0; Williams R, 2006, BIOL LETT-UK, V2, P497, DOI 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0510; Camazine S., 2001, SELF ORG BIOL SYSTEM; Carrington P.

Issues discussed in this context are: landfill covers and the role that they play; the effect of landfill operations such as the waste placement and leachate recirculation on liner temperature and leachate characteristics; leachate collection and the control of head on the liner; diffusion of contaminants through composite liners; the effect of geomembrane-clay liner interaction on leakage; the significance of wrinkles in a geomembrane; the effect of liner temperature on leakage; possible means of controlling liner temperature; geomembrane protection; the long-term performance of geomembranes and geosynthetic clay liners; and finally the contaminant transport implications of these issues. It is concluded that by taking a systems approach to design, construction and operations we can provide safer containment of waste and long term-environmental protection.","Queens Univ, Dept Civil Engn, GeoEngn Ctr Queens RMC, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Rowe, RK (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Civil Engn, GeoEngn Ctr Queens RMC, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",kerry@civil.queensu.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Funding for the research infrastructure used to obtain most of the results leading to the conclusions in this paper was provided by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Innovation Trust (OIT-MRI).

However, we have hardly found a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to a failed social system beyond ""stove-piped"" academic disciplines. This paper identifies a new holistic and interdisciplinary systems engineering methodology of systems engineering for a social system through a case study of Japan's insurance industry. The new methodology is a ""soft"" systems-approach to accommodate goals of stake-holders in a failed social system. First, the three elements of a social system are identified. Second, the multiple viewpoint model transforms these three elements of the human activity view to a new set of elements of the Holon view. Third, a social system of the Holon view is redefined as a Socio-Critical System (SCS). Finally, the Vee Model is applied for fixing a problem in the SCS. From 2005 to 2008, massive claims-payment failures cases were found in Japan's private insurance companies. They became big social scandals. The insurance claims-payment system is a typical SCS. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan's financial services supervision authority, identified, with the ""unintended"" systems approach, dysfunctions of the insurance claims-payment system. This FSA action, even though the authority was not aware of the effectiveness of the methodology, proved to be positive in applying the Vee Model for solving failures in those claims-payment systems.

This implies full cost recovery for providing water and wastewater services to users. This study proposes a new approach to help water utilities plan to meet the requirements of the new regulations. A causal loop diagram is developed for a financially self-sustaining water utility which frames water and wastewater network management as a complex system with multiple interconnections and feedback loops. The novel System Dynamics approach is used to develop a demonstration model for water and wastewater network management. This is the first known application of System Dynamics to water and wastewater network management. The network simulated is that of a typical Canadian water utility that has under invested in maintenance. Model results show that with no proactive rehabilitation strategy the utility will need to substantially increase its user fees to achieve financial sustainability. This increase is further exacerbated when price elasticity of water demand is considered. When the utility pursues proactive rehabilitation, financial sustainability is achieved with lower user fees. Having demonstrated the significance of feedback loops for financial management of water and wastewater networks, the paper makes the case for a more complete utility model that considers the complexity of the system by incorporating all feedback loops.

The evaluation of various design scenarios for the given requirements of a specific MIS is also difficult. Currently, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and the modeling language SysML provide a novel means for the systematic design of MTSs. However, the specific requirements of MTS behavior modeling, i.e., continuous dynamics or even discrete/continuous hybrid behavior modeling, and automatic simulation and evaluation of the behavior models, are not supported by SysML which intends to create descriptive static design models. Therefore, extension should be made for SysML to support detailed hybrid behavior modeling and the transformation between hybrid models in SysML and executable simulation models in certain simulation environment. For this study, a meta-model based method is proposed to integrate the system design and simulation models of MTSs. First, a set of stereotypes is defined to facilitate the designer to explicitly model hybrid dynamic behavior based on SysML. The necessary simulation information is also formalized in SysML to support an analysis of the system dynamic behavior with the aid of simulations. Finally, the SysML-based system dynamic behavior, and the related simulation information are integrated with the platform-specific simulation model through a bidirectional model transformation approach based on a triple graph grammar (TGG), which facilitates the automatic model consistency and traceability between system design and simulation. The proposed method is implemented and illustrated by using an Inverted Pendulum System (IPS). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, despite the vast amount of literature available on systems engineering and project management, about two-thirds of all projects still fail. A review of both project management and systems engineering publications reveals that most of these works focus on processes. We suggest focusing on people project managers and systems engineers. One of our previous studies dealt with project managers; this article focuses on systems engineers. This article presents findings of a study aimed at exploring the relationship among systems engineers' capacity for engineering systems thinking (CEST), project types, and project success. The instrument used in this study was a self-report questionnaire, composed of three parts. The first part assessed the participants' CEST, the second part assessed several measures of project success, and the third part assessed four dimensions of project type. The simple random sampling method was used, and the sample included 114 senior systems engineers who were randomly selected from the sampling frame. The study findings show that there is a statistically significant correlation between CEST and project success. The extent of the project's novelty, complexity, and technological uncertainty are moderator variables that affect this correlation.","[Frank, Moti; Sadeh, Arik] HIT, Fac Management Technol, Holon, Israel; [Ashkenasi, Sharon] IMI, Rocket Syst Div, Ramat Hasharon, Israel","Frank, M (reprint author), HIT, Fac Management Technol, Holon, Israel.",,,,,,"Anastasi A., 1988, PSYCHOL TESTING; [Anonymous], 1985, ADM SCI Q, DOI DOI 10.2307/2392695; Davidz HL, 2008, SYSTEMS ENG, V11, P1, DOI 10.1002/sys.20081; BARON RM, 1986, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V51, P1173, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Holland CP, 1999, IEEE SOFTWARE, V16, P30, DOI 10.1109/52.765784; Frazier PA, 2004, J COUNS PSYCHOL, V51, P115, DOI 10.1037/0022-0167.51.1.115; Standing C, 2006, IND MANAGE DATA SYST, V106, P1148, DOI 10.1108/02635570610710809; Lipovetsky S, 1997, R&D MANAGE, V27, P97, DOI 10.1111/1467-9310.00047; ARNOLD EP, 2006, P 16 ANN S INT COUNC; BAKER N, 1988, HDB PROJECT MANAGEME, P902; *BOST U, 2010, PROJ MAN COMP MOD; Chua DKH, 1999, J CONSTR ENG M ASCE, V125, P142, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1999)125:3(142); COOPER RG, 1987, J PROD INNOVAT MANAG, V4, P169, DOI 10.1016/0737-6782(87)90002-6; DERRO ME, 2009, P AER C, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/AERO.2009.4839712; Dvir D., 2006, PROJECT MANAGEMENT J, V37, P36; Dvir D., 2003, INT J PROJ MANAG, V21, P89, DOI 10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00012-1; EDUMFOTWE ET, 2000, INT J PROJ MANAG, V18, P111; Frampton K., 2006, AUSTR C INF SYST ACI; Frank M., 2006, Systems Engineering, V9, DOI 10.1002/sys.20048; FRANK M, 2005, SYST ENG, V8, P187, DOI 10.1002/sys.20025; Frank M, 2010, SYSTEMS ENG, V13, P161, DOI 10.1002/sys.20140; Frank M., 2009, P 7 ANN C SYST ENG R; Freeman M., 1992, PROJECT MANAGEMENT J, V23, P8; INCOSE, 2004, SYST ENG HDB VERS 2A; INCOSE, 2010, SYST ENG HDB VERS 3; *INCOSE UK, 2010, SYST ENG COMP FRAM; *JPL, 2006, ADV PRACT SYST ENG J; KIM DH, 1995, SYSTEMS THINKING TOO; *KPMG, 2001, PROJ RISK MAN; Lawrence P.R., 1967, ORG ENV MANAGING DIF; McDermott I., 1997, ART SYSTEMS THINKING; Nah F.F.-H., 2001, BUSINESS PROCESS MAN, V7, P285, DOI DOI 10.1108/14637150110392782; NASA, 2007, SYST ENG HDB; PENNINGS JM, 1992, RES ORGAN BEHAV, V14, P267; Pinto J., 1988, PROJECT MANAGEMENT J, V19, P67; PINTO JK, 1990, IEEE T ENG MANAGE, V37, P269, DOI 10.1109/17.62322; Project Management Institute - PMI, 2008, GUID PROJ MAN BOD KN; *PROJTECH, 2003, REAS PROJ FAIL; RICHMOND B, 2000, THINK SYST THINK; Sadeh A., 2000, PROJECT MANAGEMENT J, V31, P14; Senge P.

MBSE focuses the system engineering process on system modeling. Thus, requirements derivation, system design, integration, verification, and validation activities all center around the model of the system. System models can be built in many ways. This paper presents an approach using DoDAF. Visual accessibility of the DoDAF views facilitates full participation by all system stakeholders, including the customers, developers, and implementers, and enables the necessary dialogue. The approach promotes communications among the members of the development team and speeds up the iterations of the systems engineering process. The paper illustrates the utility of the DoDAF artifacts by means of a simplified but comprehensive, easy to follow, illustrative example. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most IGFC system analysis efforts performed to-date have employed non-dimensional SOFC models, which predict SOFC performance based upon global mass and energy balances that do not resolve important intrinsic constraints of SOFC operation, such as the limits of internal temperatures and species concentrations. In this work, a detailed dimensional planar SOFC model is applied in IGFC system analysis to investigate these constraints and their implications and effects on the system performance. The analysis results further confirm the need for employing a dimensional SOFC model in IGFC system design. To maintain the SOFC internal temperature within a safe operating range, the required cooling air flow rate is much larger than that predicted by the non-dimensional SOFC model, which results in a larger air compressor design and operating power that significantly reduces the system efficiency. Options to mitigate the challenges introduced by considering the intrinsic constraints of SOFC operation in the analyses and improve IGFC design and operation have also been investigated. Novel design concepts that include staged SOFC stacks and cascading air flow can achieve a system efficiency that is close to that of the baseline analyses, which did not consider the intrinsic SOFC limitations.

Maintaining the level of sustainability in the face of perturbations, which is robustness of sustainability, is relatively unexplored. Perturbations can be classed as noise (common in a specific system environment). shock (uncommon, either in occurrence, magnitude or duration), cycle or trend. Livestock production systems are hierarchical structures of nested systems. Lower system levels are from the biological and ecological domains (animals and micro-organisms), intermediate levels are predominantly from the technical domain (pen, barn and herd) and higher levels are from the social domain (production chain, livestock production sector). Resilience theory is the model for maintaining system features in the presence of perturbations in ecosystems and social systems. It is merely a descriptive approach, due to the low level of design and human control in these systems. Robustness theory is an equivalent model to describe and understand the maintenance of system features in biological and technical systems under perturbations. Additionally, robust design theory distinguishes concept design (choice of concept, components and materials). parameter design (optimal configuration of control factors given the concept design) and tolerance design (eliminating causes of variation) to deal with perturbations and their effect on the system. Technical systems of current livestock production systems are heavily based on tolerance design, but an interesting opportunity for new designs is to utilise the animal's intrinsic adaptation capacity and incorporate concept design and parameter design for over-all robustness. Concept design strategies for robustness include diversity and heterogeneity of components, functional redundancy and modularity. A fourth level of design, called hierarchy design, is needed to ensure that higher system levels support lower system levels of livestock production systems for optimal robustness. To enhance over-all robustness of livestock production systems for sustainability, a specific approach is needed for each system level and these approaches should be integrated and balanced.

In this paper we follow a systems engineering approach to design a biomedical signal processing system. We discuss requirements capturing, specification definition, implementation and testing of a classification system. These steps are executed as formal as possible. The requirements, which motivate the system design, are based on diabetes research. The main requirement for the classification system is to be a reliable component of a machine which controls diabetes. Reliability is very important, because uncontrolled diabetes may lead to hyperglycaemia (raised blood sugar) and over a period of time may cause serious damage to many of the body systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels. In a second step, these requirements are refined into a formal CSP parallel to B model. The formal model expresses the system functionality in a clear and semantically strong way. Subsequently, the proven system model was translated into an implementation. This implementation was tested with use cases and failure cases. Formal modeling and automated model checking gave us deep insight in the system functionality. This insight enabled us to create a reliable and trustworthy implementation. With extensive tests we established trust in the reliability of the implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this work, an investment risk assessment methodology is presented that takes account of a wide range of whole-system parameters, and provides a bridge between a device-centric evidence base and the wider systems-level data that is required in order to effectively assess the case for a specific investment. Within the paper, a system modeling framework is presented, and a case study assessment is conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. The results indicate that by considering a proposed scheme in terms of both its efficacy as an operating system, along with specific lifecycle factors from concept to disposal, risks and costs can be identified in a systematic and justifiable manner. In addition, technical factors can be described in terms of their effects on the primary capability of the system, namely to produce electricity at an economically feasible cost whilst maximizing return on investment.","[Rowley, Paul N.; Watson, Simon J.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Ctr Renewable Energy Syst Technol, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England","Wilson, DM (reprint author), Frazer Nash Consultancy, Bristol BS1 5TE, Avon, England.",d.wilson@fnc.co.uk; P.N.Rowley@lboro.ac.uk; S.J.Watson@lboro.ac.uk,"Watson, Simon/D-3828-2009",,,,"Moorhouse DJ, 2002, J AIRCRAFT, V39, P190, DOI 10.2514/2.2916; Andrews JD, 2008, RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE, V93, P1861, DOI 10.1016/j.ress.2008.03.009; BOLSTAD WM, 2007, INTRO BAYESIAN STAT, P199; Bryden IG, 2006, P I CIVIL ENG-MAR EN, V159, P55; *BS ISO IEC, 155042004 BS ISOIEC; *BS ISO IEC, 152882002 BS ISOIEC; Cameron C., 2007, IEEE INT C SYST SYST; *DEP BUS ENT REG R, 2007, 08P47 URN DEP BUS EN; *DEP TRAD IND, 2007, 071392 URN DEP TRAD; *DEP TRAD IND, 2006, CAP GRANT SCHEM SCRO; *DEP TRAD IND, 2007, 07944 DEP TRAD IND; *DEP TRAD IND, 2003, 031433 URN DEP TRAD; *DEP TRAD IND, 2006, CAP GRANT SCHEM N HO; *DEP TRAD IND, 2006, DEC OFFSH REN EN INS; *DEP TRAD IND, 2005, CAP GRANT SCHEM N HO; *DEP TRAD IND, 2005, 05864 URN DEP TRAD I; Eberly LE, 2004, J STAT PLAN INFER, V121, P191, DOI 10.1016/S0378-3758(03)00134-4; Fingersh L., 2006, NRELTP50040566; *GREAT GABB OFFSH, 2007, 577000403MGT100GGR10; HUTT J, 2005, SKILLS RENEWABLE ENE; *MIN DEF, 2001, WHAT AR TECHN READ L; MORGAN CA, 2003, 3914BR01; *NUCL EN AG, 2005, PROJ COSTS GEN EL 20; *OFF GAS EL MARK, 2009, 1709 OFF GAS EL MARK; PEARSON D, 2001, BWEA 23 BRIGHT UK; *SCOTT GOV, 2008, MOD CHANG REN OBL RE; *SCOTT HYDR TRANSM, 2008, PROP HVDC LINK SHETL; *SHETL ISL COUNC, SHETL STAT 2003; TREASURY HM, 2010, GREEN BOOK, P26; Vallen M., 1999, ELECT J, V12, P28, DOI 10.1016/S1040-6190(99)00076-7; WATSON I, 2008, WREC 10 GLASG UK JUL; *WOLFR RES INC, 2010, CENTR LIM THEOR; WOODMAN B, 2008, ENERG POLICY, V39, P4527",33,5,5,2,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-8184,,,IEEE SYST J,IEEE Syst.

In analogy to design principles, the question arises: Why are some operating strategies encountered more frequently than others and in what sense might they be superior? It is at this point impossible to study operation principles in complete generality, but the work here discusses the important situation where a biological system must shift operation from its normal steady state to a new steady state. This situation is quite common and includes many stress responses. We present two distinct methods for determining different solutions to this task of achieving a new target steady state. Both methods utilize the property of S-system models within Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) that steady states can be explicitly represented as systems of linear algebraic equations. The first method uses matrix inversion, a pseudo-inverse, or regression to characterize the entire admissible solution space. Operations on the basis of the solution space permit modest alterations of the transients toward the target steady state. The second method uses standard or mixed integer linear programming to determine admissible solutions that satisfy criteria of functional effectiveness, which are specified beforehand. As an illustration, we use both methods to characterize alternative response patterns of yeast subjected to heat stress, and compare them with observations from the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a steady-state design and simulation tool for a highly-integrated tubular SOFC system. The SOFC is modeled using a high fidelity, one-dimensional tube model coupled to a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Recuperative heat exchange between SOFC tail-gas and inlet cathode air and reformer air/fuel preheat processes are captured within the CFD model. Quasi one-dimensional thermal resistance models of the tail-gas combustor (TGC) and catalytic partial oxidation (CPOx) complete the balance of plant (BoP) and SOFC coupling. The simulation tool is demonstrated on a prototype 66-tube SOFC system with 650W of nominal gross power. Stack cooling predominately occurs at the external surface of the tubes where radiation accounts for 66-92% of heat transfer. A strong relationship develops between the power output of a tube and its view factor to the relatively cold cylinder wall surrounding the bundle. The bundle geometry yields seven view factor groupings which correspond to seven power groupings with tube powers ranging from 7.6-10.8W. Furthermore, the low effectiveness of the co-flow recuperator contributes to lower tube powers at the bundle outer periphery. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Kattke, K. J.; Braun, R.

The first is the fundamental unsolved problem of relating the digital representation of the genotype to the analog representation of the parameters for the molecular components. For example, knowing the DNA sequence does not allow one to determine the kinetic parameters of an enzyme. The second is the fundamental unsolved problem of relating the parameters of the components and the environment to the phenotype of the global system. For example, knowing the parameters does not tell one how many qualitatively distinct phenotypes are in the organism's repertoire or the relative fitness of the phenotypes in different environments. These also are challenges for biomedical engineers as they attempt to develop therapeutic strategies to treat pathology or to redirect normal cellular functions for biotechnological purposes. In this article, the second of these fundamental challenges will be addressed, and the notion of a ""system design space"" for relating the parameter space of components to the phenotype space of bioengineering systems will be focused upon. First, the concept of a system design space will be motivated by introducing one of its key components from an intuitive perspective. Second, a simple linear example will be used to illustrate a generic method for constructing the design space in which qualitatively distinct phenotypes can be identified and counted, their fitness analyzed and compared, and their tolerance to change measured. Third, two examples of nonlinear systems from different areas of biomedical engineering will be presented. Finally, after giving reference to a few other applications that have made use of the system design space approach to reveal important design principles, some concluding remarks concerning challenges and opportunities for further development will be made.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biomed Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Savageau, MA (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biomed Engn, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",masavageau@ucdavis.edu,,,U.S. Public Health Service [R01-GM30054]; Center for Non-Linear Studies of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,"I thank Julie Sutcliffe as well as Erik Welf and Jason Haugh for sharing figures from their study, Rick Fasani for assistance in constructing the system design spaces, and Pedro Coelho, Dean Tolla, Phillip Seitzer, and Jason Lomnitz for their fruitful discussions.

Threshold processes are also ubiquitous in signal transduction. This study takes a modular systems approach to systematically understand the interaction of adaptive modules and threshold modules (both monostable and bistable). The authors employ representative modules of adaptive and threshold elements and use these to examine and analyse various aspects of their interaction including the order of interconnection, the role of relative time scales, the difference between monostable and bistable thresholds in this context and how threshold modules may act as a switch induced by transient signals. Numerical simulations, bifurcation analysis and analytical work are employed to address these questions. Overall, the authors' analysis is a first step towards a detailed systems engineering understanding of the different kinds of interactions between these ubiquitous elements in cellular signal transduction.","[Seaton, D.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Syst & Synthet Biol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Seaton, D (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",krishnan@icex.imperial.ac.uk,"Seaton, Daniel/E-6346-2011",,EPSRC,"D.

Information systems form a cornerstone of PHI research and implementation, representing significant progress for the nascent field. However, PHI does not advocate or incorporate standard, domain-appropriate design methods for implementing public health information systems. Reusable design is generalized design advice that can be reused in a range of similar contexts. We propose that PHI create and reuse information design knowledge by taking a systems approach that incorporates design methods from the disciplines of Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design and other related disciplines. Discussion: Although PHI operates in a domain with unique characteristics, many design problems in public health correspond to classic design problems, suggesting that existing design methods and solution approaches are applicable to the design of public health information systems. Among the numerous methodological frameworks used in other disciplines, we identify scenario-based design and participatory design as two widely-employed methodologies that are appropriate for adoption as PHI standards. We make the case that these methods show promise to create reusable design knowledge in PHI. Summary: We propose the formalization of a set of standard design methods within PHI that can be used to pursue a strategy of design knowledge creation and reuse for cost-effective, interoperable public health information systems. We suggest that all public health informaticians should be able to use these design methods and the methods should be incorporated into PHI training.","[Reeder, Blaine; Demiris, George] Univ Washington, Sch Nursing, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hills, Rebecca A.; Demiris, George; Pina, Jamie] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Revere, Debra] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Reeder, B (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Nursing, Box 359442, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",breeder@uw.edu,,,National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Training Grant [T15 LM007442-07]; Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics in the Department of Medical Education and Biomedical Informatics at the University of Washington,"This project was funded in part by the National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Training Grant T15 LM007442-07.

The articles in this issue situate the study of language use in two kinds of context that are central to an understanding of ""languaging"" activities in the social settings in which they occur. The first is the context of dynamical systems theory. Wallot and Van Orden show how a dynamical systems approach can illuminate language use as the intentional and creative activity that it is. Cowley and Thibault illustrate the distributed language approach. Cowley follows Gibson (1979/1986) in comparing language understanding to picture perception. Thibault illustrates the wholly embedded nature of language use in an evocative example of 2 boys offering a description of aliens they have learned about in a story. All of the contributors emphasize language as embodied social action deeply embedded in the social contexts of talking. The articles in this issue and its predecessor, Ecological Psychology 22(4), offer valuable insights for development of an ecological theory of language use. Gibson claims that the information available to perceptual systems of different species is specific to environmental events and therefore it is not arbitrary .... Dialogically coordinated utterance activity between individuals in talk is an extension of this fundamental principle, not something that is completely different.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a functional approach it is shown how an increasing complexity of controller structures follows an increasing ability to make more complex decisions. Two applications are used to analyze that in detail: first, the controller structures necessary for Miller's living systems and for Beer's viable systems are presented in one comparable scheme. Second, a complex controller structure illustrates the basic requirements for a brain. Findings - Analyzing necessary decisions in Beer's viable systems it is shown how the elementary decisions found in feedback systems can be used as a first approximation for decision making. Hence, it is shown how principles of decision making determine the development of complex controller structures. Practical implications - The paper provides basic analytic tools to understand the interrelation between controller structures and the content of the decision these structures can make. It shows four different evolutionary paths from feedback systems towards brain structures. Also it emphasizes the role of goal values in decision making and their importance especially for social systems. Originality/value - The paper seeks to present cybernetics as a science of structures that enable certain decisions. It is suggested that making explicit the goal orientation of decision making gives cybernetics an additional relevance for the social sciences.","Nechansky Engn Efficiency, Vienna, Austria","Nechansky, H (reprint author), Nechansky Engn Efficiency, Vienna, Austria.",hn@nechansky.co.at,,,,,"Nechansky H, 2007, KYBERNETES, V36, P157, DOI 10.1108/03684920710741206; Locke EA, 2002, AM PSYCHOL, V57, P705, DOI 10.1037//0003-066X.57.9.705; Beer S., 1981, BRAIN FIRM; Beer S., 1979, HEART ENTERPRISE; Ludyk G., 1995, THEORETISCHE REGELUN; MILLER JG, 1990, BEHAV SCI, V35, P157, DOI 10.1002/bs.3830350301; Miller J.G., 1978, LIVING SYSTEMS; Nechansky H, 2010, KYBERNETES, V39, P553, DOI 10.1108/03684921011036781; Nechansky H, 2010, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V27, P97, DOI 10.1002/sres.955; Nechansky H., 2008, CYBERNET SYST, P185; Nechansky H, 2010, KYBERNETES, V39, P55, DOI 10.1108/03684921011021273; Nechansky H, 2008, KYBERNETES, V37, P83, DOI 10.1108/03684920810851005; Nechansky H, 2009, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V26, P411, DOI 10.1002/sres.942; Nechansky H, 2008, KYBERNETES, V37, P265, DOI 10.1108/03684920810851177; Nechansky H., 2006, CYBERNET SYST, P97",15,6,6,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2011,40,2-Jan,,,,,63,79,,10.1108/03684921111117933,,17,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Computer Science,768GI,WOS:000290921400007,J,"Hasirci, U; Balikci, A; Zabar, Z; Birenbaum, L",,,,"Hasirci, Ugur; Balikci, Abdulkadir; Zabar, Zivan; Birenbaum, Leo",,,"A Novel Magnetic-Levitation System: Design, Implementation, and Nonlinear Control",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,15th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch (EML) Technology,"MAY 17-20, 2010","Royal Military Acad (RMA), Brussels, BELGIUM",,Royal Military Acad (RMA),Electromagnetic launchers (EMLs); linear induction launchers (LILs); magnetic-levitation (maglev) trains; nonlinear control,LINEAR INDUCTION LAUNCHERS; PERFORMANCE; FORCE,"This paper concerns the design, implementation, and nonlinear velocity-tracking control of a novel magnetic-levitation (maglev) system for magnetically levitated trains. The proposed system uses only one tubular linear induction motor to produce three forces required in a maglev system: propulsion, levitation, and guidance. Classical maglev systems, on the other hand, contain a separate force-generating system to build each of these three forces. Another benefit that the proposed system offers is that there is no need to control the guidance, and particularly, the levitation forces, one of the most challenging tasks in maglev systems. The system always centers the moving part during operation and eliminates the necessity for control of the levitation and guidance forces. However, the propulsion force strongly requires some control efforts because a linear induction motor has nonlinear system dynamics. This paper gives a condensed design guideline based on the mature theory of electromagnetic launchers, particularly the linear induction launcher type. It explains the implementation process, shows experimental test results, and finally, presents a nonlinear partial state-feedback controller for the proposed system.","[Hasirci, Ugur] Gebze Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, TR-41400 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Balikci, Abdulkadir; Zabar, Zivan; Birenbaum, Leo] NYU, Polytech Inst, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, New York, NY 10004 USA","Hasirci, U (reprint author), Gebze Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, TR-41400 Kocaeli, Turkey.",uhasirci@gyte.edu.tr; a.balikci@gyte.edu.tr; zzabar@poly.edu; lbirenba@duke.poly.edu,,,,,"Wai RJ, 2003, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V50, P920, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2003.817577; Yan LG, 2008, IEEE T APPL SUPERCON, V18, P92, DOI 10.1109/TASC.2008.922239; Kim KB, 1996, IEEE T MAGN, V32, P478; Balikci A, 2005, IEEE T MAGN, V41, P171, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2004.839283; Balikci A, 2003, IEEE T MAGN, V39, P97, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2002.805856; HU Q, 2007, P IEEE INT C AUT LOG; Kemper H., 1934, German Patent, Patent No. [644 303, 644303]; KRISTIC M, 1995, NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE C, P29; Laithwaite E.

In the early 1970's a multidisciplinary program was established in CSIRO's Division of Land Resources Management to, among other issues, research and develop models to assist in the resolution of persistent and multi-faceted environmental issues. The authors of this paper were members of that group. We recently decided to look at what has been learned about these reasonably intractable problems over the more than 30 years period since. If it is true that the half life of modelling papers is around eight years and, apparently, decreasing (Haggett, 2005), then we can expect that the wheel has often been reinvented. So we describe issues as they were expressed up to the early 1980's and compare and contrast them with concerns after the turn of the century in two contexts - the development of systems thinking in modelling and deciding when and how to model. Three general criticisms of systems analysis were evident then: (1) the models were highly mathematical and therefore opaque to the user, and it was hard even for 'experts' to explain unexpected findings; (2) welfare, as expressed by economic or utilitarian criteria, was considered to be poorly represented in systems practice (systems thinking was being viewed here as rational, while it was slowly being recognized that apparently irrational behaviour is an important part of the social fabric and could not be ignored (Glazer, 1978)); (3) the systems approach relied on lists derived from planners, but in the absence of ""systems thinking"" guidelines they were only lists of what planners thought of doing, not comprehensive in any strong sense. These three major drawbacks still exist and in much the same form today. Development of systems thinking is now much more widespread. The applications gap does not appear to be filled, though there have been attempts to broaden the client base by participative model construction to reach a consensus of what is agreeable to most stakeholders. ""Irrational behaviour"" still threatens systems analysis and comes in several forms. There is lack of acceptance that utilitarian criteria should be used to drive the solution. And the consequences of implementing a model's solution may lead to unforeseen consequences and behaviours by and to affected parties. Very few papers have been written in recent years on guidelines on when to model and when not to do so. There seems to be no connection with earlier publications. The field does not appear to have progressed. We perceive a world in which those who can, model, and those who can't still feel little need to try. It is to be hoped that interest in the issues of when and why to model will not wane. It would be a shame, perhaps a source of conflict, if modelling remained yet another marker that separates a 'them' from an 'us'. Some of us have now been much closer to decision-makers. Our observations include: (a) Timing is critical in decision-making. Sometimes there are a few hours for deliberation, for others decades. A modeller has to be close to help with the quick ones. Advice that comes too late will not be relevant. (b) Close contact with decision makers is essential, as is their training. (c) A contract from the client is a desirable/necessary precondition. (d) Trust, and lack of it, will always be important in accepting advice. (e) Committees, especially those charged with doing something and feel that they cannot progress without assistance, are good targets.

However, how can this be done in the face of system complexity and uncertainties? In this paper we briefly discuss practical ways that policy makers can take up the systems challenge. We focus on resilience thinking, and the use of influence diagrams, causal-loop diagrams, and system archetypes. As a case study, set in the context of the climate-energy-water nexus, we use some of these system concepts and tools to carry out an initial exploration of factors that can affect the resilience of the Australian National Electricity Market. We stress the need for the electricity sector to prepare for the impacts of global change by encouraging innovation and diversity, supporting modularity and redundancy, and embracing the need for a policy making approach that takes account of the dynamics of the wider social-ecological system. Finally, taking a longer term view, we conclude by recommending that policy makers work to reduce reliance on conventional market mechanisms, institute continuing cross-sector dialogue, and promote basic education in system dynamics.","[Newell, Barry] Australian Natl Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Marsh, Debborah M.; Sharma, Deepak] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Newell, B (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,"Australian National University; University of Technology, Sydney","This work is a part of a joint ANU-UTS Climate-Energy-Water Links Project, which was funded by The Australian National University, through the Hilda John Water Endowment Fund, and the University of Technology, Sydney.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the processes and outcomes of the systems approach adopted. METHODS: National schemes for engagement with different providers were applied. Additional human resources were provided to assist with implementation. All health care providers were mapped, a concise training module and advocacy kit were developed, and sensitisation and training activities were conducted. National advocacy efforts complemented local initiatives. Data were captured in a PPM-focused surveillance system. RESULTS: Intensified PPM resulted in a 12% increase in notification of new smear-positive pulmonary TB cases. Contribution to case notification by providers varied widely: health department 67%, medical colleges 16%, private practitioners 6%, non-government organisations 7%, and the rest 4%. Treatment success was above the 85% target for all sectors combined. Strong public sector implementation and differentiation of roles and responsibilities among providers played major roles. The lessons learnt have been used by the RNTCP to inform future policy development. CONCLUSION: The systems approach to the intensified PPM scale-up used in the 14 cities was productive. However, many challenges and barriers to scale-up of PPM DOTS in India remain.","[Lal, S.

Indeed, there is a growing consensus that there is no single cause, and that PD is a multifactorial systemic condition, in which a number of factors may determine its etiopathogenesis. We describe a systems approach that addresses the multifactorial aspects of PD and overcomes constraints on conventional experimentation imposed by PD's causal complexity, its long temporal duration, and its uniqueness to human brains. Specifically, a mathematical model of brain energy metabolism is used as a core module to which other modules describing cellular processes thought to be associated with PD can be attached and studied in an integrative environment. Employing brain energy usage as the core of a systems approach also enables the potential role that compromised energy metabolism may have in the etiology of PD. Although developed for PD, it has not escaped our attention that the energy systems approach outlined here could also be applied to other neurodegenerative disorders-most notably Alzheimer's disease.

In this paper we have undertaken a review of the contribution that systems thinking has been making more recently, especially to the practice of OR. Systems thinking is a discipline in its own right, with many theoretical and methodological developments, but it is also applicable to almost any problem area because of its generality, and so such a review must always be selective. We have looked at the literature from both a theoretical and an applications orientation. In the first part we consider the main systems theories and methodologies in terms of their recent developments and also their applications. This covers: the systems approach, complexity theory, cybernetics, system dynamics, soft OR and PSMs, critical systems and multimethodology. In the second part we review the main domains of application: strategy, information systems, organisations, production and operations, ecology and agriculture, and medicine and health. Our overall conclusion is that while systems may not be well established institutionally, in terms of academic departments, it is incredibly healthy in terms of the quantity and variety of its applications.

The International Health Regulations (IHR[2005]) off er one of these strategic themes whereby World Health Organization (WHO) Member States and global partners engaged in biosecurity, biosurveillance and public health can define commonalities and leverage their respective missions and resources to optimize interventions. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) works with partner countries across clinical, veterinary, epidemiological, and laboratory communities to enhance national disease surveillance, detection, diagnostic, and reporting capabilities. CBEP, like many other capacity building programs, has wrestled with ways to improve partner country buy-in and ownership and to develop sustainable solutions that impact integrated disease surveillance outcomes. Designing successful implementation strategies represents a complex and challenging exercise and requires robust and transparent collaboration at the country level. To address this challenge, the Laboratory Systems Development Branch of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CBEP have partnered to create a set of tools that brings together key leadership of the surveillance system into a deliberate system design process. This process takes into account strengths and limitations of the existing system, how the components inter-connect and relate to one another, and how they can be systematically refined within the local context. The planning tools encourage cross-disciplinary thinking, critical evaluation and analysis of existing capabilities, and discussions across organizational and departmental lines toward a shared course of action and purpose. The underlying concepts and methodology of these tools are presented here.","[Taboy, Celine H.; Albetkova, Adilya; Rayfield, Mark A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lab Syst Dev Branch, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Chapman, Will; Kennedy, Sarah] Def Threat Reduct Agcy, Cooperat Biol Engagement Program, Ft Belvoir, VA 22060 USA","Taboy, CH (reprint author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lab Syst Dev Branch, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",CTaboy@cdc.gov,,,,,"Tugwell P, 2006, BRIT MED J, V332, P358, DOI 10.1136/bmj.332.7537.358; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; KEUSCH GT, 2009, I MED NATL RES COUNC, P1; U.S. CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control Prevention), 2001, MMWR-MORBID MORTAL W, V50, P1; WHO, 2007, EV BUS STRENGTH HLTH; *WORLD ORG AN HLTH, 2008, OIE TOOL EV PERF VET",6,7,8,2,14,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,3-Dec,2010,10,,,1,,,,,S6,10.1186/1471-2458-10-S1-S6,,6,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",759WN,WOS:000290279300006,21143828J,"Fettke, P; Houy, C; Loos, P",,,,"Fettke, Peter; Houy, Constantin; Loos, Peter",,,"On the Relevance of Design Knowledge for Design-Oriented Business and Information Systems Engineering Conceptual Foundations, Application Example, and Implications",BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Design-oriented research; Design science; Business and information systems engineering,SCIENCE,"In general, research in business and information systems engineering (BISE) focuses on the design of business information systems. So far, the prevailing design-oriented research has taken a technique-oriented perspective, which focuses on the creation and application of innovative techniques such as methods, models, software prototypes, and similar artifacts for system design. In this paper we argue that design knowledge is of considerable importance for system design. Relevant design knowledge includes, for example, knowledge about design objectives, design techniques, and effects resulting from the use of techniques. This design knowledge can be produced, evaluated, and used in a scientific way. In this paper we present necessary basics for conceptualizing design knowledge. We illustrate the applicability of the conceptual foundations and the relevance of design knowledge using the example of ""event-driven process chains (EPC)"". A discussion of implications of the presented results and future challenges for design-oriented BISE concludes the contribution.","[Fettke, Peter; Houy, Constantin; Loos, Peter] DFKI GmbH, IWi, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Fettke, Peter; Houy, Constantin; Loos, Peter] Univ Saarland, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany","Fettke, P (reprint author), DFKI GmbH, IWi, Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",peter.fettke@iwi.dfki.de; constantin.houy@iwi.dfki.de; peter.loos@iwi.dfki.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01BS0833],"The presented research findings were partly developed in the course of the research project ""Prozessorientierter Web-2.0-basierter integrierter Telekommunikationsservice (PROWIT)"", which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number FKZ 01BS0833.

The long-term health outcome and well-being of individuals identified by newborn screening represents a meaningful measurement of the performance of the newborn screening system. This assessment of long-term follow-up requires a systems approach that connects 'stakeholders, processes, and outcomes through the collection, integration, evaluation, and sharing of key data and metrics. Methods: A review of the principles of a systems approach and its application to newborn screening long-term follow-up was performed. Past and current efforts by HRSA/MCHB that address individual components of newborn screening were assessed and utilized to outline lessons learned and suggest next steps. Results: The principle features of a systems approach applied to the creation and utilization of a health information exchange system for the long-term follow up of screen positive patients is defined. The application of this approach is in progress through the HRSA/MCHB's Effective Follow-up in Newborn Screening project. Conclusions: While several elements are in place to realize a systems approach, the authors think that the key is an integrated, multidirectional health information exchange system that functions locally, regionally and nationally, and enables information exchange between private and public health sectors.

This explains the perfect homoeostasis of the energetic intermediate PCr (phosphocreatine) in heart. When using drugs specifically stimulating either supply or demand activities, MoCA helped reveal the very specific mode of regulation of heart contraction energetics. Only activation of myofibrils activity (demand), either by increasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentration or myofibrils sensitivity to Ca(2+), triggers activation of contractile activity. In contrast, the activation of mitochondrial activity (supply) has strictly no effect on contraction, either directly or through PCr changes (intermediate).","[Deschodt-Arsac, Veronique; Calmettes, Guillaume; Gouspillou, Gilles; Rouland, Richard; Thiaudiere, Eric; Miraux, Sylvain; Franconi, Jean-Michel; Diolez, Philippe] Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS, UMR5536, Bordeaux 2, France","Diolez, P (reprint author), Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS, UMR5536, Bordeaux 2, France.",,,,Association Francaise contre les Myopathies [AFM 12338],"This work was supported, in part, by the Association Francaise contre les Myopathies [grant number AFM 12338]","Mildaziene V, 1996, BIOCHEM J, V320, P329; Arsac LM, 2008, BIOCHEM J, V414, P391, DOI 10.1042/BJ20080280; Kavanagh NI, 2000, BBA-BIOENERGETICS, V1457, P57, DOI 10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00054-2; Brand MD, 2002, BIOCHEM SOC T, V30, P25; Balaban RS, 2003, AM J PHYSIOL-CELL PH, V284, pC285, DOI 10.1152/ajpcell.00129.2002; Diolez P, 2007, AM J PHYSIOL-REG I, V293, pR13, DOI 10.1152/ajpregu.00189.2006; BALABAN RS, 1986, SCIENCE, V232, P1121, DOI 10.1126/science.3704638; Balaban RS, 2002, J MOL CELL CARDIOL, V34, P1259, DOI 10.1006/jmcc.2002.2082; Korzeniewski B, 2005, BIOPHYS CHEM, V116, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.bpc.2005.04.001; Calmettes G, 2010, PLOS ONE, V5, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0009306; Calmettes G, 2008, AM J PHYSIOL-REG I, V295, pR1891, DOI 10.1152/ajpregu.90548.2008; Diolez P, 2000, BTK2000 ANIMATING CE, P101; Endoh M, 2006, J PHARMACOL SCI, V100, P525, DOI 10.1254/jphs.CPJ06009X; JOHNSTON JD, 1987, BIOCHEM J, V245, P217; Korzeniewski B, 2009, BIOCHEM J, V423, P421, DOI 10.1042/BJ20090395; Korzeniewski B, 2008, BIOCHEM J, V413, P343, DOI 10.1042/BJ20080162; Kushmerick MJ, 1995, J BIOENERG BIOMEMBR, V27, P555, DOI 10.1007/BF02111654; WU ST, 1992, CELL CALCIUM, V13, P235, DOI 10.1016/0143-4160(92)90012-H",18,2,2,0,3,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"THIRD FLOOR, EAGLE HOUSE, 16 PROCTER STREET, LONDON WC1V 6 NX, ENGLAND",0300-5127,,,BIOCHEM SOC T,Biochem.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a quarantine pest of mango, Mangifera indica L., in South Africa. The aim of the study was to test cultural and chemical control measures in a systems approach for risk mitigation of S. mangiferae in South Africa. A large-scale experiment, using a randomized block design with three replicates, was undertaken on 'Tommy Atkins' mangoes in South Africa. Five treatment combinations were applied over two seasons: 1) untreated control; 2) sanitation and physical removal of egg-infested fruit (P+S); 3) thiamethoxam, P+S; 4) thiamethoxam, fipronil, P+S; and 5) thiamethoxam, two fenthion applications, P+S. A weekly random sample of eight fruit from 40 trees per orchard was taken from 5 wk to harvest over two harvest periods. In total, 57,600 fruit were sampled. In a separate experiment, the same variety was used to test the efficacy of covering fruit with paper bags over one season in a completely randomized design. In both trials, all the pests were recorded from internal and external fruit inspections. In trial 1, results after the first season showed >98% control in the three chemical combination treatments. In the second season, treatment 2 provided 19% and treatment 3 99.9% control, whereas no fruit were infested with S. mangiferae in treatments 4 and 5. Trial two showed that fruit bagging significantly reduced S. mangiferae infestation. The data showed that a systems approach for S. mangiferae control in South Africa can be effective and that bagging can be an effective organic control option.","Westfalia Technol Serv, ZA-0850 Tzaneen, South Africa","de Graaf, J (reprint author), Westfalia Technol Serv, POB 1103, ZA-0850 Tzaneen, South Africa.",johandg@westfalia.co.za,"Al Adawi, Ali/H-4593-2011",,Westfalia Fruit Estates (Pty) Ltd.; South African Mango Growers Association,"I thank E.

We discuss the pointing, acquisition, and tracking of laser terminals and describe how laser beams with low divergence can be used to transmit data at multi-Gigabits per second. Investigating the influence of the atmosphere, background light, and flight qualification requirements on system design, we explain why the data rates in free-space optical communications are still significantly below those possible in today's terrestrial fiber-based systems. Techniques like forward-error correction, adaptive optics, and diversity reception are discussed. Such measures help to increase the data rate or link distance while keeping the bit error ratio and outage probability of the optical HAP communication system low.","[Fidler, Franz; Leeb, Walter R.] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Commun & Radio Frequency Engn, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Knapek, Markus; Horwath, Joachim] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Commun & Nav, D-82234 Wessling, Germany","Fidler, F (reprint author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Commun & Radio Frequency Engn, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",ffidler@nt.tuwien.ac.at; markus.knapek@dlr.de,,,European Cooperation in Science and Technology,This work was supported by COST297 (European Cooperation in Science and Technology: High-Altitude Platforms for Communications and Other Services) under the Sixth European Research and Technological Development Framework Program.,"ANDREWS L.C, 2005, LASER BEAM PROPAGATI; KOGELNIK H, 1966, PR INST ELECTR ELECT, V54, P1312, DOI 10.1109/PROC.1966.5119; Weyrauch T, 2002, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V4489, P177, DOI 10.1117/12.453227; Horwath J, 2007, INT J SATELL COMM N, V25, P501, DOI 10.1002/sat.888; Miura R, 2003, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V24, P341, DOI 10.1023/A:1022507025134; Tozer TC, 2001, ELECTRON COMMUN ENG, V13, P127, DOI 10.1049/ecej:20010303; Fujiwara Y, 2007, ACTA ASTRONAUT, V61, P163, DOI 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.021; KLEIN BJ, 1974, APPL OPTICS, V13, P2134, DOI 10.1364/AO.13.002134; LEEB WR, 1989, APPL OPTICS, V28, P3443, DOI 10.1364/AO.28.003443; ANTONINI M, 2006, AER C BIG SKY MT; Avdikos G., 2008, P 10 INT WORKSH SIGN, P1; BAISTER G, 1994, ELECTRON COMMUN ENG, V6, P271, DOI 10.1049/ecej:19940605; BETTI S, 2008, P S COMM SYST NETW D, P77; Biswas A, 2005, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V5712, P205, DOI 10.1117/12.600834; Caplan D.

The virulence of Francisella tularensis depends on its growth capabilities within a defined environmental niche of the host cell. Results: We reconstructed the metabolism of Francisella as a stoichiometric matrix. This systems biology approach demonstrated that changes in carbohydrate utilization and amino acid metabolism play a pivotal role in growth, acid resistance, and energy homeostasis during infection with Francisella. We also show how varying the expression of certain metabolic genes in different environments efficiently controls the metabolic capacity of F. tularensis. Selective gene-expression analysis showed modulation of sugar catabolism by switching from oxidative metabolism (TCA cycle) in the initial stages of infection to fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis later on. Computational analysis with constraints derived from experimental data revealed a limited set of metabolic genes that are operational during infection. Conclusions: This integrated systems approach provides an important tool to understand the pathogenesis of an ill-characterized biothreat agent and to identify potential novel drug targets when rapid target identification is required should such microbes be intentionally released or become epidemic.","[Raghunathan, Anu; Shin, Sookil; Daefler, Simon] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Raghunathan, Anu] Natl Chem Lab, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India","Daefler, S (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Med, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029 USA.",simon.daefler@mssm.edu,,, [TMTI0049_09_RD_T],We thank Avellino Texiera for valuable suggestions on amino acid analysis using HPLC.

Systems medicine, the translational science counterpart to basic science's systems biology, is the interface at which these tools may be constructed. Rapid initial strides in improving sepsis treatment are possible through the use of phenomenological modelling and optimization tools for process understanding and device design. Higher impact, and more generalizable, treatment designs are based on mechanistic understanding developed through the use of physiologically based models, characterization of population variability, and the use of control-theoretic systems engineering concepts. In this review we introduce acute inflammation and sepsis as an example of just one area that is currently underserved by the systems medicine community, and, therefore, an area in which contributions of all types can be made.","[Parker, Robert S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Swanson Sch Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Parker, Robert S.; Clermont, Gilles] Univ Pittsburgh, McGowan Inst Regenerat Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Clermont, Gilles] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Crit Care Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Parker, RS (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Swanson Sch Engn, 1249 Benedum Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",rparker@pitt.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (USA)/NHLBI [R01-HL080926],"Funding for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health (USA)/NHLBI (grant no.

S. military forces developed and implemented the Joint Theater Trauma System (JTTS) and the Joint Theater Trauma Registry based on U. S. civilian trauma system models. The purpose of this analysis was to develop battlefield injury outcome benchmark metrics and to evaluate the impact of JTTS-driven performance improvement interventions. Methods: To quantify these achievements, the Joint Theater Trauma Registry captured mechanistic, physiologic, diagnostic, therapeutic, and outcome data on 18,377 injured patients from January 2004 to May 2008 for analysis. Benchmarks were developed and statistically validated by using control chart methodology. Results: The majority (66.4%) of battlefield wounds were penetrating mechanism, 23.3% of all patients had an Injury Severity Score of >= 16, 21.8% had a base deficit of >= 5, 30.5% of patients required blood, and 6.8% required massive transfusion (>= 10 units red blood cell per 24 hours). In this severely injured population from the battlefield, the JTTS developed several pertinent benchmark metrics to assess quality of care associated with postinjury complications and mortality. The implementation of 27 JTTS-developed evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines and an improved information dissemination process was associated with a decrease in aggregate postinjury complications by 54%. Conclusions: Despite the numerous challenges of a global trauma system, the JTTS has set the standard for trauma care on the modern battlefield utilizing evidence-based medicine. The development of injury care benchmarks enhanced the evolution of the combat casualty care performance improvement process within the trauma system.","[Eastridge, Brian J.] USA, Inst Surg Res, MCMR SRJ, Ft Sam Houston, TX 78234 USA; [Holcomb, John B.] Univ Texas Houston, Hlth Sci Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Flaherty, Stephen] Landstuhl Reg Med Ctr, Landstuhl, Germany; [Dunne, James] Bethesda Naval Med Ctr, Bethesda, MD USA; [Casscells, S.

A generic preview design problem, which features both previewable and nonpreviewable disturbances, is embedded in a standard generalized regulator framework. Preview regulation is accomplished by a two-degrees-of-freedom output-feedback controller. A number of theoretical issues are studied, including the efficient solution of the standard H-2 full-information Riccati equation and the efficient evaluation of the full-information preview gain matrices. The full-information problem is then extended to include the efficient implementation of the output-feedback controller. The synthesis of feedforward controllers with preview is analyzed as a special case-this problem is of interest to designers who wish to introduce preview as a separate part of a system design. The way in which preview reduces the H-2-norm of the closed-loop system is analyzed in detail. Closed-loop norm reduction formulas provide a systematic way of establishing how much preview is required to solve a particular problem, and determine when extending the preview horizon will not produce worthwhile benefits. The paper concludes with a summary of the main features of preview control, as well as some controller design insights. New application examples are introduced by reference.","[Hazell, A.

Despite decades-long use of principles in system dynamics (e.g. feedback control), current crop models often contain many empirical elements, and model parameters may have little biological meaning. Building on the experience in designing the relatively new model GECROS, we believe models can be made less empirical by employing existing physiological understanding and mathematical tools. In view of the potential added value of robust crop modelling to classical quantitative genetics, model input parameters are increasingly considered to represent 'genetic coefficients'. The advent of functional genomics and systems biology enables the elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of these coefficients. A number of case studies, in which the effects of quantitative trait loci or genes have been incorporated into existing ecophysiological models, have shown the promise of using models in analysing genotype-phenotype relationships of some crop traits. For further progress, crop models must be upgraded based on understanding at lower organizational levels for complicated phenomena such as sink formation in response to environmental cues, sink feedback on source activity, and photosynthetic acclimation to the prevailing environment. Within this context, the recently proposed 'crop systems biology', which combines modern genomics, traditional physiology and biochemistry, and advanced modelling, is believed ultimately to realize the expected roles of in silico modelling in narrowing genotype-phenotype gaps. This review summarizes recent findings and our opinions on perspectives for modelling genotypexenvironment interactions at crop level.","[Yin, Xinyou; Struik, Paul C.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands","Yin, XY (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, POB 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.",Xinyou.Yin@wur.nl,,,,,"Flexas J, 2008, PLANT CELL ENVIRON, V31, P602, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01757.x;

Selecting programs that provide the greatest impact is difficult because of the complex set of causal pathways and delays that link risk factors to CVD. We describe a system dynamics simulation model developed for a county health department that incorporates and tracks the effects of those risk factors over time on both first-time and recurrent events. We also describe how the model was used to evaluate the potential impacts of various intervention strategies for reducing the county's CVD burden and present the results of those policy tests.

However, compared with the speed with which genomic microbial sequencing has provided us with a wealth of data to study biological functions, it is a slow process. So far only a few projects have emerged whose synthetic ambition even remotely matches our analytic capabilities. Here, we survey current technologies converging into a future ability to engineer large-scale biological systems. We argue that the underlying synthetic technology, de novo DNA synthesis, is already rather mature in particular relative to the scope of our current synthetic ambitions. Furthermore, technologies towards rationalizing the design of the newly synthesized DNA fragment are emerging. These include techniques to implement complex regulatory circuits, suites of parts on a DNA and RNA level to fine tune gene expression, and supporting computational tools. As such DNA fragments will, in most cases, be destined for operating in a cellular context, attention has to be paid to the potential interactions of the host with the functions encoded on the engineered DNA fragment. Here, the need of biological systems engineering to deal with a robust and predictable bacterial host coincides with current scientific efforts to theoretically and experimentally explore minimal bacterial genomes.","[Dietz, Sven; Panke, Sven] ETHZ, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Panke, S (reprint author), ETHZ, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Mattenstr 26, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",sven.panke@bsse.ethz.ch,,,European Union,This work was supported by the European Union FP6 project EMERGENCE.

Expert system; Decision support system (DSS); Decision criteria,LOSSES,"Animal waste has always been considered as a resource for agricultural input as biofertilizer. However, the management is becoming more stringent due to environmental regulations. Livestock producers are faced with different manure management options that may be implemented into their operations. Given the expansion of the livestock industry, the implementation of environmental regulations, and the increasing importance of social and health issues, the selection of optimal manure management systems is becoming a strategically important task. Increasingly, integrated decision support systems (DSSs) are becoming necessary to assist decision makers in their evaluation of different manure management alternatives, like, liquid system, semi-solid system, solid system and bio-gas or bio-energy system based on combinations of different manure management sub-systems (collection, storage and application). To address this situation, a user-friendly computer program called Integrated Swine Manure Management (ISMM) is being developed for the Canadian Prairie provinces. Decision criteria including environmental, agronomic, social and health, greenhouse gas emission, and economic factors have been considered for the selection. design, and operation of the DSS. The expert system modeling is based on Visual Basic programming. Decision on adopting a particular combination of systems components is based on performance rating of the overall system. The program is interactive so that weighting factors for the different decision criteria can be varied to suit site-specific considerations. In this paper, the systems approach for development of an integrated liquid manure management system is discussed. Using a case study, sensitivity analysis of different combinations of management components is also reported for systems performance. The decision software compared satisfactorily with other available DSS packages. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It documents the changes that took place in the farming system in Soroti district during an outbreak of African cassava mosaic virus disease (ACMVD) and the subsequent decline in cassava production the main staple food in the area. Resultant adaptation impacts are analysed across cropping, biological, economic and social systems each of which operate as an interlinked sub-systems. The policy implications of this story suggest a policy agenda that recognises adaptation capacity as the life blood of complex adaptive systems. Since these types of system are found in all realms of human activity, it follows that strengthening this capacity is a key developmental priority that requires linking together new configurations of actors and resources to tackle an ever changing set of contexts.

The first part of the paper reviews three significant paradigm shifts of Checkland's system thinking in the view of the system movement. The first shift is that system thinking is developed from the general system thinking to applied systems thinking. The second shift is that the applied system thinking is transferred from Hard System Thinking (HST) to Soft System Thinking (SST). The third shift is that the social paradigm of applied system thinking is diverted from functionalism to the interpretive tradition for dealing with human affairs. According to these three shifts, this paper ascribes Checkland's system thinking to four core concepts: the human activity system, the purposeful holon, the learning system and two pairs of system concepts. It indicates that Checkland's system thinking is a significant milestone in the history of system movement. The second part of this paper provides some criticisms and suggestions for Checkland's system thinking. Firstly, it criticizes the philosophical attitude of extreme subjectivism. It implies that the functionalism approach which based on positivism and the interpretive paradigm which based on the phenomenology are complementary rather than mutually exclusive when we deal with the complexity of social reality. Secondly, it analyses the latest achievement of system movement after 1970s and suggests that SST should be extended to three pairs of system concepts by supplementing 'self-organization and adaptive evolution' as the third pair of systems concepts.

Moreover, the systems approach can assist in the organization of information and identification of knowledge gaps and thereby open an avenue to multi-disciplinary research projects.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Hirooka, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",hirooka@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan [JFS-09-26006-1]","This work was supported by a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan (JFS-09-26006-1).","Tabata Y, 2009, ANIM SCI J, V80, P475, DOI 10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00650.x;

These present very difficult systems thinking problems that will have to be solved if a systems approach is to be successfully applied to creating and sustaining the military capabilities and forces that the UK will need for the twenty-first century. Beginning with the nature of capability and introducing the concepts of capability engineering and through-life capability management, this paper explores the nature of these challenges from the perspectives of history and the author's experiences in working with colleagues in the UK and Allied defence acquisition communities. In his analysis, he identifies four 'next great systems thinking challenges': language, complexity, longevity and agility, overcoming each of which will require innovation in research and the development of new systems engineering and systems thinking practices. Looking further ahead, the author lists some of the emerging problems for defence, where taking a systems thinking approach could be particularly critical for success: demography, skills, education and human factors; security and the complexity of joined-up government; and the pace of technology advance. These are candidates for future next great challenges. Concluding, he notes that systems thinkers in defence are not alone. Complex capability engineering problems can also be found in energy, air and rail transport, complex IT networks, major civil engineering projects, and medicine and health care. Defence can learn a lot from systems thinkers in the civil world, and the civil world can learn a lot from defence.","UK Minist Def, Def Sci & Technol Lab, Salisbury SP4 0JQ, Wilts, England","Oxenham, D (reprint author), UK Minist Def, Def Sci & Technol Lab, Salisbury SP4 0JQ, Wilts, England.",daoxenham@mail.dstl.gov.uk,,,,,"Bowden M, 1999, BLACK HAWK DOWN; Elliott C., 2007, CREATING SYSTEMS WOR; Galloway Joseph, 1992, WE WERE SOLDIERS ONC; Gongora T, 2000, REVOLUTION MILITARY; *NAT AUD OFF, 2002, BUILD AIR MAN CAP IN; *NAT AUD OFF, 2003, THROUGH LIF MAN; *STAT OFF, 2005, CM6697; *STAT OFF, 2003, CM60411",8,2,2,3,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1028-6608,,,CIV ENG ENVIRON SYST,Civ.

The development of novel treatments and the comparison of the effects of novel and existing treatments in osteoporosis are complicated by the difficulties of establishing drug effects on disease progression, as reflected in the slowly changing primary biomarker, bone mineral density. In recent years, research has considerably improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Specifically, various biomarkers have been identified that reflect bone physiology at the cellular level. These biomarkers mirror the dynamics of bone formation and degradation on a shorter timescale than bone mineral density as a composite measure. These markers can therefore, in principle, be used to characterize the underlying regulatory system and to quantify drug effects in osteoporosis. Recently, the concept of disease system analysis has been proposed as a novel approach to characterize, in a strictly quantitative manner, drug effects on disease progression. This approach integrates physiology, disease progression and drug treatment in a comprehensive mechanism-based model, using dynamic information on a network of biomarkers. This review focuses on the use of disease system analysis for the characterization of drug effects on osteoporosis. It is concluded that, although the development of fully mechanistic disease system models may be practically impossible, parsimonious - but mechanism-based disease system models may ultimately be used to adequately predict the long-term effects of drug treatment on clinical outcomes.","[Danhof, Meindert] Leiden Univ, Gorlaeus Labs, Leiden Amsterdam Ctr Drug Res, Div Pharmacol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Cremers, Serge C.

The traditional command-and-control approach is now less effective because an increasing amount of responsibility to deliver public goods and services falls on networks of nongovernment agencies. Even though public administrators are seeking new decision-making models in an increasingly more complex environment, the public sector currently only sparsely utilizes Mediated Modeling (MM). There is growing evidence, however, that by employing MM and similar tools, public interest networks can be better equipped to deal with their long-term viability while maintaining the short-term needs of their clients. However, it may require a shift in organizational culture within and between organizations to achieve the desired results. This paper explores the successes and barriers to implementing MM and similar tools in the public sector and offers insights into utilizing them through a review of case studies and interdisciplinary literature. We aim to raise a broader interest in MM and similar tools among public sector administrators at various administrative levels. We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on those cases operating at the interface of ecology and socio-economic systems.","[van den Belt, Marjan] Massey Univ, New Zealand Ctr Ecol Econ, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Kenyan, Jennifer R.; Krueger, Elizabeth; Maynard, Alison; Roy, Matthew Galen; Raphael, Ian] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT USA","van den Belt, M (reprint author), Massey Univ, New Zealand Ctr Ecol Econ, C Landcare Res,Private Bag 11-052, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",M.vandenBelt@massey.ac.nz,,,,,"Akkermans H.

One of the problems when developing a new product is a high-risk of investment return that prevents many companies from innovation and development of new products. In order to reduce the risk, a model of innovation diffusion should be included in a new product development. There are few theories in literature that examine diffusion of new products, but they focus on specific segments of diffusion process. Within the scope of this work, we propose a model of product diffusion in the market based on the concepts of systems thinking and the methodology of system dynamics. The model focuses on comprehensiveness, and it helps the management to understand the diffusion process. Using the model, one can simulate how the market will accept a product depending on its specific characteristics. Based on the predictions, it is possible to choose the optimal characteristics of a product for the predefined market.

We consider solvent-based chemisorption techniques, carbonate looping technology, and the so-called oxyfuel process. For each technology option, we give an overview of the technology, listing advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, a discussion of the level of technological maturity is presented, and we conclude by identifying current gaps in knowledge and suggest areas with significant scope for future work. We then discuss the suitability of using ionic liquids as novel, environmentally benign solvents with which to capture CO2. In addition, we consider alternatives to simply sequestering CO2-we present a discussion on the possibility of recycling captured CO2 and exploiting it as a C-1 building block for the sustainable manufacture of polymers, fine chemicals, and liquid fuels. Finally, we present a discussion of relevant systems engineering methodologies in carbon capture system design.","[MacDowell, Niall; Florin, Nick; Fennell, Paul] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Ctr CCS, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [MacDowell, Niall; Galindo, Amparo; Jackson, George; Adjiman, Claire S.; Shah, Nilay] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Buchard, Antoine; Hallett, Jason; Williams, Charlotte K.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England","MacDowell, N (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Ctr CCS, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",p.fennell@imperial.ac.uk,"Williams, Charlotte/A-2503-2013; fennell, paul/G-4772-2013; Florin, Nick/J-8330-2014; Adjiman, Claire/G-3638-2013; Jackson, George/D-3649-2015; Shah, Nilay/E-4925-2015; Galindo, Amparo/D-3169-2015; Hallett, Jason/A-3281-2012; Buchard, Antoine/D-4821-2013","fennell, paul/0000-0002-6001-5285; Florin, Nick/0000-0002-8436-4711; Adjiman, Claire/0000-0002-4573-7722; Jackson, George/0000-0002-8029-8868; Shah, Nilay/0000-0002-8906-6844; Galindo, Amparo/0000-0002-4902-4156; Hallett, Jason/0000-0003-3431-2371; Buchard, Antoine/0000-0003-3417-5194",British Coal Utilisation and Research Association (BCURA) [BCURA B82]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of the UK [EP/E016340/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of the UK [NE/H01392X/1]; Grantham Institute for Climate Change,"N.M.D. thanks the British Coal Utilisation and Research Association (BCURA) for the funding of a PhD studentship, BCURA B82, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of the UK (Grant number: EP/E016340/1, Molecular Systems Engineering group) as well as support from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of the UK (Grant number: NE/H01392X/1) is also acknowledged.

The suspension is designed to provide a stable platform to keep the wheel treads on tract, to insulate the car and the driver from the surface irregularities and to take part of good handling properties. The surface condition of the lake beds is basically flat without undulations but with inconsistent surface textures and ridges. Spring with nonlinear rate is used with the reason that the resistance builds up roughly proportional to the aerodynamic download for keeping the height more nearly constant. The objective of the work is to produce an efficient method for assisting the design of suspension system. At the initial step, the stiffness and the damping constants are determined based on RMS optimization by following the optimization strategy i.e. to minimize the absolute acceleration respect to the relative displacement of the suspension. Power bond graph technique is then used to model the nonlinearity of the components i.e. spring and dashpot of the suspension system. This technique also enables to incorporate the interactions of dynamic response of the vehicle's body with aerodynamic flow as a result of the base excitation of the ground to the wheels. The simulation is conducted on the platform of Simulink-MATLAB and the interactions amongst the components within the system are observed in time domain to evaluate the effectiveness of the suspension.","Univ Nottingham, Dept Mech Mat & Mfg Engn, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Pagwiwoko, CP (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Dept Mech Mat & Mfg Engn, Malaysia Campus, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",,,,,,"ACKROYD J, 1984, JUST FOR RECORD, P9; Borutzky W, 2009, SIMUL MODEL PRACT TH, V17, P3, DOI 10.1016/j.simpat.2007.08.008; JAZAR RN, 2008, VEHICLE DYNAMICS THE, P884; Kroo I., 2001, AIRCRAFT DESIGN SYNT; AEON HOLLOW RUBBER S",5,0,0,0,4,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-7912-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2010,7522,,,,,,,,752244,10.1117/12.851304,,11,Mechanics; Optics,Mechanics; Optics,BSR97,WOS:000285572800146,B,"Scholberg, JMS; Dogliotti, S; Zotarelli, L; Cherr, CM; Leoni, C; Rossing, WAH",,"Lichtfouse, E",,"Scholberg, Johannes M.

However, the inherent complexity of cover-crop-based systems hampers their adoption by conventional farmers. Therefore, special management skills and alternative research and technology transfer approaches may be required to facilitate their adoptive use by conventional farmers. We propose that development and adoption of suitable cover-crop-based production systems may require the use of an ""innovation framework"" that includes (1) identification of system constraints, (2) analysis of system behavior, (3) exploration of alternative systems, and (4) system design and selection. We describe case studies from four regions of the Americas (Florida, USA; Parana and Santa Catarina, Brazil; and Canelones, Uruguay) that illustrate the relationships between this innovation framework and the development and adoption of cover-crop-based production systems. Where successful, development and adoption of such systems appear to relate to a number of attributes including (1) active involvement by farmers in research and dissemination programs; (2) integration of cover crops into production systems without net loss of land or labor resources; (3) informing farmers of the (direct) benefits of cover crop use; (4) provision of multiple benefits by cover crops, (5) sufficient access to information, inputs, and technologies required for cover crop use; and (6) provision of skills and experience necessary to manage cover crops effectively. Where these attributes are absent and failure to innovate has prevented development and adoption of cover-crop-based systems, policy initiatives to reward farmers for ecological services provided by cover crops may be required.","[Scholberg, Johannes M.

Finding a solution to such a PDF model is essential for system design, simulation, and process control purpose. However, major difficulties appear when solving PDEs with singularity. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite difference, finite element, and polynomial based orthogonal collocation, not only have limitations to fully capture the process dynamics but also demand enormous computation power due to the large number of elements or mesh points for accommodation of sharp variations. To tackle this challenging problem, wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods have been recently developed with successful applications to a fixed-bed adsorption column model. Our investigation has shown that recent advances in wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods have the potential to be adopted for solving more complicated dynamic system models. This chapter will highlight the successful applications of these new methods in solving complex models of simulated-moving-bed (SMB) chromatographic processes. A SMB process is a distributed parameter system and can be mathematically described by a set of partial/ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. These equations are highly coupled; experience wave propagations with steep front, and require significant numerical effort to solve. To demonstrate the numerical computing power of the wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods, a single column chromatographic process modelled by a Transport-Dispersive-Equilibrium linear model is investigated first. Numerical solutions from the upwind-1 finite difference, wavelet-collocation, and high resolution methods are evaluated by quantitative comparisons with the analytical solution for a range of Peclet numbers. After that, the advantages of the wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods are further demonstrated through applications to a dynamic SMB model for an enantiomers separation process. This research has revealed that for a PDE system with a low Peclet number, all existing numerical methods work well, but the upwind finite difference method consumes the most time for the same degree of accuracy of the numerical solution. The high resolution method provides an accurate numerical solution for a PDE system with a medium Peclet number. The wavelet collocation method is capable of catching up steep changes in the solution, and thus can be used for solving PDE models with high singularity. For the complex SMB system models under consideration, both the wavelet based approaches and high resolution methods are good candidates in terms of computation demand and prediction accuracy on the steep front. The high resolution methods have shown better stability in achieving steady state in the specific case studied in this Chapter.","[Yao, Hongmei; Zhang, Tonghua; Tade, Moses O.] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Proc Syst Computat, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Tian, Yu-Chu] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Yao, HM (reprint author), Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Proc Syst Computat, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",,"Tian, Yu-Chu/I-9948-2012; Zhang, Tonghua/A-9069-2012","Zhang, Tonghua/0000-0003-0510-1428",,,"Minceva M, 2003, CHEM ENG PROCESS, V42, P93, DOI 10.1016/S0255-2701(02)00038-7; DORFI EA, 1987, J COMPUT PHYS, V69, P175, DOI 10.1016/0021-9991(87)90161-6; Huang WZ, 1996, APPL NUMER MATH, V20, P101, DOI 10.1016/0168-9274(95)00119-0; Bindal A, 2003, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V27, P131, DOI 10.1016/S0098-1354(02)00165-5; Qamar S, 2006, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V30, P1119, DOI 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.02.012; VASILYEV OV, 1995, J COMPUT PHYS, V120, P33, DOI 10.1006/jcph.1995.1147; Yao H, 2008, IND ENG CHEM RES, V47, P5585, DOI 10.1021/ie071246g; Jiang GS, 1996, J COMPUT PHYS, V126, P202, DOI 10.1006/jcph.1996.0130; Li ST, 1997, J COMPUT PHYS, V131, P368, DOI 10.1006/jcph.1996.5611; Biegler LT, 2004, SEP PURIF REV, V33, P1, DOI 10.1080/SPM-120039562; MILLER K, 1981, SIAM J NUMER ANAL, V18, P1019, DOI 10.1137/0718070; LAPIDUS L, 1952, J PHYS CHEM-US, V56, P984, DOI 10.1021/j150500a014; Gunawan R, 2004, AICHE J, V50, P2738, DOI 10.1002/aic.10228; Pais LS, 1997, CHEM ENG SCI, V52, P245, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2509(96)00398-3; Bertoluzza S, 1996, APPL COMPUT HARMON A, V3, P1, DOI 10.1006/acha.1996.0001; BERTOLUZZA S, 1994, COMPUT APPL MATH, V13, P13; BLOM JG, 1994, ACM T MATH SOFTWARE, V20, P194, DOI 10.1145/178365.178391; BRIESEN H, 2005, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V29, P139; Ching CB, 1998, CHEM ENG SCI, V53, P1311, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2509(97)00442-9; Cruz P, 2002, AICHE J, V48, P774, DOI 10.1002/aic.690480412; Cruz P, 2001, CHEM ENG SCI, V56, P3305, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2509(00)00551-0; Donoho DL, 1992, INTERPOLATING WAVELE; EIGENBERGER G, 1976, CHEM ENG SCI, V31, P681, DOI 10.1016/0009-2509(76)87011-X; FURZELAND RM, 1990, J COMPUT PHYS, V89, P349, DOI 10.1016/0021-9991(90)90148-T; Gu T., 1995, MATH MODELLING SCALE; HU SS, 1981, ADV COMPUTER METHODS, P305; KOREN B, 1993, NMR9308 CWI; Lim YI, 2001, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V25, P653, DOI 10.1016/S0098-1354(01)00646-9; Lim YI, 2001, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V25, P1483, DOI 10.1016/S0098-1354(01)00712-8; Liu Y, 2001, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V25, P1611, DOI 10.1016/S0098-1354(01)00724-4; NIKOLAOU M, 1994, WAVELET APPL CHEM EN, P210; PETZOLD LR, 1987, APPL NUMER MATH, V3, P347, DOI 10.1016/0168-9274(87)90039-0; REVILLA MA, 1986, INT J NUMER METH ENG, V23, P2263, DOI 10.1002/nme.1620231208; SANZSERNA JM, 1986, J COMPUT PHYS, V67, P348, DOI 10.1016/0021-9991(86)90267-6; Wouwer AV, 1998, APPL NUMER MATH, V26, P49; Zhang TH, 2008, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V32, P2403, DOI 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2008.01.002",36,0,0,0,1,"NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC",HAUPPAUGE,"400 OSER AVE, STE 1600, HAUPPAUGE, NY 11788-3635 USA",,,978-1-60741-047-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,273,302,,,,30,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,BRU20,WOS:000283687400010,J,"Sleimen-Malkoun, R; Temprado, JJ; Berton, E",,,,"Sleimen-Malkoun, Rita; Temprado, Jean-Jacques; Berton, Eric",,,A dynamic systems approach to bimanual coordination in stroke: implications for rehabilitation and research,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,,,English,Review,,,,,,stroke; bimanual coordination; dynamical systems; rehabilitation,HEMIPLEGIC CEREBRAL-PALSY; INTERLIMB COORDINATION; BILATERAL MOVEMENT; UPPER LIMBS; MODEL; TIME; CONSTRAINTS; PERFORMANCE; SEVERITY; DISCRETE,"During the last 30 years, the dynamic systems approach to coordination patterns contributed to shed new lights on the principles governing interlimb coordination, its dynamics, and its neural basis, predominantly in healthy people. In the present paper, we aim to show how these concepts could provide a theoretical and a methodological framework to address bimanual coordination dysfunction and rehabilitation in stroke patients. Compared to conventional approaches to research and rehabilitation in stroke, the one proposed in this paper is original since it seeks to assess and improve the impaired limb through (and in) coordination tasks. We concretely envisage a number of implications of the ""dynamic systems"" view to understand the behavioral consequences of intrinsic asymmetries (due to central nervous system injury) on bimanual dynamics in stroke and to identify how to exploit the central nervous system plasticity and self-organizing properties for recovering more adaptive coordinated movements. We conclude that more interest should be accorded to bimanual coordination assessment and rehabilitation in stroke. In this respect, the dynamical systems approach provides interesting insights and valuable tools. Experimental and clinical studies are still needed in order to elaborate firm and founded guidelines for therapy.","[Sleimen-Malkoun, Rita] Inst Sci Mouvement E J Marey, Fac Sci Sport, CNRS, UMR 6233, F-13288 Marseille, France; Univ Aix Marseille 2, Marseille, France","Sleimen-Malkoun, R (reprint author), Inst Sci Mouvement E J Marey, Fac Sci Sport, CNRS, UMR 6233, 163 Ave Luminy,BP 910, F-13288 Marseille, France.",,,,,,"Waller SM, 2008, NEUROREHABILITATION, V23, P29; Kamper DG, 2002, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V83, P702, DOI 10.1053/apmr.2002.32446; SCHONER G, 1990, BIOL CYBERN, V63, P257, DOI 10.1007/BF00203449; Carson RG, 2005, BRAIN RES REV, V49, P641, DOI 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.03.005; Riek S, 2003, EXP BRAIN RES, V153, P59, DOI 10.1007/s00221-003-1581-7; Carson RG, 2000, EXP BRAIN RES, V131, P196, DOI 10.1007/s002219900272; de Oliveira SC, 2002, ACTA PSYCHOL, V110, P139; HAKEN H, 1985, BIOL CYBERN, V51, P347, DOI 10.1007/BF00336922; Kwakkel G, 2003, STROKE, V34, P2181, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.0000087172.16305.CD; Lewis GN, 2004, J MOTOR BEHAV, V36, P174, DOI 10.3200/JMBR.36.2.174-188; Rose DK, 2005, CLIN REHABIL, V19, P452, DOI 10.1191/0269215505cr806oa; Stewart KC, 2006, J NEUROL SCI, V244, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.jns.2006.01.005; Harris-Love ML, 2005, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V86, P2131, DOI 10.1016/j.apmr.2005.05.006; Carson RG, 2004, EXP BRAIN RES, V154, P267, DOI 10.1007/s00221-003-1726-8; KELSO JAS, 1983, Q J EXP PSYCHOL-A, V35, P347; KELSO JAS, 1979, J EXP PSYCHOL HUMAN, V5, P229, DOI 10.1037/0096-1523.5.2.229; KELSO JAS, 1981, B PSYCHONOMIC SOC, V18, P63; Oujamaa L., 2009, Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, V52, P269, DOI 10.1016/j.rehab.2008.10.003; Cauraugh JH, 2005, PROG NEUROBIOL, V75, P309, DOI 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.04.001; Harbourne RT, 2009, PHYS THER, V89, P267, DOI 10.2522/ptj.20080130; FRANZ EA, 1991, ACTA PSYCHOL, V77, P137, DOI 10.1016/0001-6918(91)90028-X; Krebs HI, 1999, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V96, P4645, DOI 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4645; Banerjee A, 2007, BIOL CYBERN, V96, P265, DOI 10.1007/s00422-006-0114-4; BINGHAM GP, 1991, J EXP PSYCHOL HUMAN, V17, P359, DOI 10.1037/0096-1523.17.2.359; CORCOS DM, 1984, RES Q EXERCISE SPORT, V55, P117; EMMERIK REA, 2004, ECOLOGICAL TASK ANAL; Fonseca ST, 2001, CLIN BIOMECH, V16, P793, DOI 10.1016/S0268-0033(01)00067-5; Fonseca ST, 2004, PHYS THER, V84, P344; Fuchs A, 2000, HUM MOVEMENT SCI, V19, P425, DOI 10.1016/S0167-9457(00)00025-7; Garry MI, 2005, HUM MOVEMENT SCI, V24, P849, DOI 10.1016/j.humov.2005.10.005; Haken H., 1983, SYNERGETICS INTRO; Holt KG, 2000, HUM MOVEMENT SCI, V19, P375, DOI 10.1016/S0167-9457(00)00019-1; HUYS R, 2008, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V4; Kelso J.

The complexities introduced by the need to include a Multi-Object Adaptive Optics system (MOAO) can be simplified by using well defined systems engineering processes. These processes include the capturing, analysis and flow down of requirements, functional and performance analysis and an integrated system design approach.

From a physics point of view, it is interesting to study conditions under which a coordination or cooperation of interacting entities will occur, be it spins, particles, bacteria, animals, or humans. Here, we analyze the case, where the entities are heterogeneous, particularly the case of two populations with conflicting interactions and two possible states. For such systems, explicit mathematical formulas will be determined for the stationary solutions and the associated eigenvalues, which determine their stability. In this way, four different types of system dynamics can be classified and the various kinds of phase transitions between them will be discussed. While these results are interesting from a physics point of view, they are also relevant for social, economic, and biological systems, as they allow one to understand conditions for (1) the breakdown of cooperation, (2) the coexistence of different behaviors (""subcultures""), (3) the evolution of commonly shared behaviors (""norms""), and (4) the occurrence of polarization or conflict. We point out that norms have a similar function in social systems that forces have in physics.","[Helbing, Dirk; Johansson, Anders] ETH, CLU, CLU E 1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Helbing, Dirk] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Helbing, Dirk] Coll Budapest, Inst Adv Study, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary","Helbing, D (reprint author), ETH, CLU, CLU E 1, Clausiusstr 50, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",dhelbing@ethz.ch,"Johansson, Anders/C-5551-2009",,ETH Competence Center [CH1-0108-2],"The authors would like to thank for partial support by the ETH Competence Center ""Coping with Crises in Complex Socio-Economic Systems"" (CCSS) through ETH Research Grant No. CH1-0108-2.

Firstly, we analyze the logistics outsourcing risk from the system thinking perspective.

Forrester's System Dynamics (SD) is another longstanding technique for modeling social systems. Several classical models of systems, such as the Kermack-McKendrick model of epidemiology, the Lotka-Volterra equations for modeling predator-prey relationships, and the Bass model for innovation diffusion are formulated as systems of differential equations and have corresponding System Dynamics representations as difference equations. The ABS and SD modeling approaches take fundamentally different perspectives when modeling a system, which can be characterized as bottom-up (ABS) versus top-down (SD). Yet many systems can be equivalently modeled by either approach. In this paper, we present a formal specification for SD and ABS models, use the specification to derive equivalent ABS representations, and present an example of an SIR epidemic model having SD and ABS counterparts.","Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Complex Adapt Agent Syst Simulat CAS2, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Macal, CM (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Complex Adapt Agent Syst Simulat CAS2, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",macal@anl.gov,,,,,"Aleman Dionne M, 2009, Proceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC 2009), DOI 10.1109/WSC.2009.5429727; Rahmandad H, 2008, MANAGE SCI, V54, P998, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1070.0787; Mickens RE, 2002, J DIFFER EQU APPL, V8, P823, DOI 10.1080/1023619021000000807; Macal CM, 2009, WINT SIMUL C PROC, P86, DOI 10.1109/WSC.2009.5429318; Bonabeau E, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P7280, DOI 10.1073/pnas.082080899; Ascher U.M., 1998, COMPUTER METHODS ORD; Bagni R, 2002, JASSS, V5; Borshchev A, 2004, 22 INT C SYST DYN SO; Epstein JM, 2008, PLOS ONE, V3, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0003955; Epstein JE, 1996, GROWING ARTIFICIAL S; Forrester J.

Systems engineering efforts for distributed simulation environments are typically based on the middleware transport used, the applications available and the constraints placed on the technical team including network, computer and personnel limitations. To facilitate community re-use, systems engineering should focus on integrated operational function decomposition. This links data elements produced within the simulation to the functional capabilities required by the user. The system design should be captured at a functional level and subsequently linked to the technical design. Doing this within a data-driven systems engineering infrastructure allows generative programming techniques to assist accurate, flexible and rapid architecture development.

Conventional energy systems tend to introduce different technologies with high conversion efficiency, leading to a higher average efficiency. Advanced energy systems can be achieved not by an aggregate form of conversion technologies but by an innovative system design itself. The concept of LCS (low carbon society) is a unique approach having multi-dimensional considerations such as social, economic and environmental dimensions. The LCS aims at an extensive restructuring of worldwide energy supply/demand network system by not only replacing the conventional parts with the new ones, but also integrating all the necessary components and designing absolutely different energy networks. As a core tool for the LCS design, energy-economic models are applied to show feasible solutions in future with alternatives such as renewable resources, combined heat and power, and smart grid operations. Models can introduce changes in energy markets, technology learning in capacity, and penetration of innovative technologies, leading to an optimum system configuration under priority settings. The paper describes recent trials of energy models application related to waste-to-energy, clean coal, transportation and rural development. Although the modelling approach is still under investigation, the output clearly shows possible options having variety of technologies and linkages between supply and demand sides. Design of the LCS means an energy systems design with the modelling approach, which gives solution for complex systems, choices among technologies, technology feasibility, R&D targets, and what we need to start.","[Nakata, Toshihiko; Rodionov, Mikhail; Silva, Diego; Jupesta, Joni] Tohoku Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan","Nakata, T (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Aoba Yama 6-6-11-815, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan.",nakata@cc.mech.tohoku.ac.jp,"lee, yunzhu/G-1723-2011; Silva Herran, Diego/B-2925-2015; Nakata, Toshihiko/E-3161-2010","Silva Herran, Diego/0000-0001-5484-4442; Nakata, Toshihiko/0000-0003-0088-9498",,,"Consonni S, 2005, WASTE MANAGE, V25, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2004.09.006; Morris SC, 2002, ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS, V7, P207, DOI 10.1023/A:1016332907313; Hiremath RB, 2007, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V11, P729, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2005.07.005; Urban F, 2007, ENERG POLICY, V35, P3473, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2006.12.025; Gul T, 2009, ENERGY, V34, P1423, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2009.04.010; Skea J, 2008, CLIM POLICY, V8, pS5, DOI 10.3763/cpol.2008.0487; Pohekar SD, 2004, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V8, P365, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2003.12.007; Wang H, 2009, ENERG POLICY, V37, P338, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.045; Van Ruijven B, 2008, WORLD DEV, V36, P2801, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.01.011; Luoranen M, 2008, WASTE MANAGE, V28, P30, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2006.12.014; Consonni S, 2005, WASTE MANAGE, V25, P123, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2004.09.007; Fulton L, 2009, ENERG POLICY, V37, P3758, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.07.065; Nakata T, 2004, PROG ENERG COMBUST, V30, P417, DOI 10.1016/j.pecs.2004.03.001; Bertalanffy L., 1976, GEN SYSTEM THEORY FD; Daskalopoulos E, 1998, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V24, P33, DOI 10.1016/S0921-3449(98)00031-7; ESMAILI H, 1972, J SANIT ENG DIV ASCE, V98, P1005; European Commission, 2006, WORLD EN TECHN OUTL; Hadley SW, 2001, ENERG POLICY, V29, P1285, DOI 10.1016/S0301-4215(01)00073-8; Holmgren K, 2004, ENERG POLICY, V32, P1807, DOI 10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00168-X; *IEA, WORLD EN OUTLOOK 200; IEA, 2006, WORLD EN OUTL 2006; IEA, 2008, CO2 EM FUEL COMB; IEA, 2008, EN TECHN PERSP; *IEA, 2008, EN TECHN PERSP SCENA; MEIER P, 1984, ENERGY SYSTEM ANAL D; METZ B, 2007, CLIMATE CHANGE 2007; Tchobanoglous G, 2002, HDB SOLID WASTE MANA; Truitt M., 1969, J SANITARY ENG DIVIS, V95, P289; United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), 2006, GLOB ANTHR EM NONCO2; US EPA, 2006, GLOB MIT NONCO2 GREE",30,9,12,4,14,SCIENCE CHINA PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7321,,,SCI CHINA TECHNOL SC,Sci.

Currently, it is witnessing another major paradigm shift by leaning towards the holistic systems based approaches rather the reductionist single molecule based methods. The effect of this new trend is likely to be felt strongly in terms of new strategies for therapeutic intervention, new targets individually and in combinations, and design of specific and safer drugs. Computational modeling and simulation form important constituents of new-age biology because they are essential to comprehend the large-scale data generated by high-throughput experiments and to generate hypotheses, which are typically iterated with experimental validation. Areas covered in this review: This review focuses on the repertoire of systems-level computational approaches currently available for target identification. The review starts with a discussion on levels of abstraction of biological systems and describes different modeling methodologies that are available for this purpose. The review then focuses on how such modeling and simulations can be applied for drug target discovery. Finally, it discusses methods for studying other important issues such as understanding targetability, identifying target combinations and predicting drug resistance, and considering them during the target identification stage itself. What the reader will gain: The reader will get an account of the various approaches for target discovery and the need for systems approaches, followed by an overview of the different modeling and simulation approaches that have been developed. An idea of the promise and limitations of the various approaches and perspectives for future development will also be obtained. Take home message: Systems thinking has now come of age enabling a 'bird's eye view' of the biological systems under study, at the same time allowing us to 'zoom in', where necessary, for a detailed description of individual components. A number of different methods available for computational modeling and simulation of biological systems can be used effectively for drug target discovery.","Indian Inst Sci, Bioinformat Ctr, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Chandra, N (reprint author), Indian Inst Sci, Bioinformat Ctr, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",nchandra@serc.iisc.ernet.in,,,DST Centre for Mathematical Biology at the Indian Institute of Science [SR/S4/MS:419/07],The author gratefully acknowledges financial support by the DST Centre for Mathematical Biology (grant no.

In these environments, remote users connecting via the public Internet or other unsecure networks must be authenticated prior to being granted access to sensitive content such as tests or personal/private records. Today, the overwhelming majority of online learning systems rely on weak authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of remote users only at the start of each session. One-time authentication using password, personal identification number (PIN), or even hardware tokens is clearly inadequate in that it cannot defend against insider attacks including remote user impersonation or illegal sharing or disclosure of these authentication secrets. As such, these methods are entirely unsuitable for circumstances where the outcome of an online assessment or a course of study is the granting of a formal degree, professional certification, or qualification or requalification for a particular skill or function. This paper examines the problem of remote authentication in online learning environments and explores the challenges and options of using biometric technology to defend against user impersonation attacks by certifying the presence of the user in front of the computer, at all times. It also leverages a 5-step process as the basis for a systems approach to ensuring that the proposed solution will meet the critical remote authentication assurance requirements. The process and systems approach employed here are generic, and can be exploited when introducing biometric-enabled authentication solutions to other applications and business domains. The paper concludes by presenting a biometrics-based client-server architecture for continuous user authentication in e-learning environments.","[Moini, Assad; Madni, Azad M.] Intelligent Syst Technol Inc, Los Angeles, CA 90066 USA","Moini, A (reprint author), Intelligent Syst Technol Inc, Los Angeles, CA 90066 USA.",amadni@intelsystech.com,,,,,"Phillips PJ, 2000, COMPUTER, V33, P56, DOI 10.1109/2.820040; Jain AK, 2004, COMMUN ACM, V47, P34, DOI 10.1145/962081.962102; Ben-Yacoub S, 1999, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V10, P1065, DOI 10.1109/72.788647; Crown DF, 1998, J BUS ETHICS, V17, P683; Passow HJ, 2006, RES HIGH EDUC, V47, P643, DOI 10.1007/s11162-006-9010-y; Bowers W.J., 1964, STUDENT DISHONESTY I; BURR WE, 2008, NIST SPECIAL PUBLICA; CAMBIER J, 2002, P 3 WORKSH AUT ID AD; Charlesworth P, 2006, J CHEM EDUC, V83, P1368; Hard SF, 2006, J HIGH EDUC, V77, P1058, DOI 10.1353/jhe.2006.0048; DERAKHSHANI R, 2003, PATTERN RECOGNIT, V17; Edling R.

A biochemical system theory (BST) model was developed for understanding the regulatory features of carotenoid metabolism during the batch cultivation. Factors that influence lutein production by C. pyrenoidosa were discussed based on the model. It shows that low flux for lycopene formation is the major bottleneck for lutein production, while by-product syntheses and Inhibitions affect the cellular lutein content much less However, with further increase of the cellular lutein content, the inhibition on lycopene formation by lutein may become a limiting factor Although speculative, these results may provide useful information for further elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid biosynthesis in Chlorella and modifying its metabolic network to enhance lutein production.","[Wu, Zheng-Yun] Sichuan Univ, Dept Food Engn, CN-610065 Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zheng-Yun; Qu, Chun-Bo; Shi, Xian-Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Food Sci & Engn, CN-200240 Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zheng-Yun; Qu, Chun-Bo; Shi, Xian-Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Bor Luh Food Safety Ctr, CN-200240 Shanghai, Peoples R China","Shi, XM (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Food Sci & Engn, CN-200240 Shanghai, Peoples R China.",xmshi@sjtu.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2006AA02Z226],This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (863 Project No 2006AA02Z226).,"Sandmann G, 2006, METAB ENG, V8, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.ymben.2006.01.005; Olaizola M, 2003, BIOMOL ENG, V20, P459, DOI 10.1016/S1389-0344(03)00076-5; Chen F, 1996, BIOTECHNOL LETT, V18, P603; Alves R, 2000, BIOINFORMATICS, V16, P534, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.6.534; Gouveia L, 1996, BIORESOURCE TECHNOL, V57, P157, DOI 10.1016/0960-8524(96)00058-2; Shi XM, 2002, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V18, P723, DOI 10.1021/pb0101987; Shi XM, 1997, J APPL PHYCOL, V9, P445, DOI 10.1023/A:1007938215655; Ducreux LJM, 2005, J EXP BOT, V56, P81, DOI 10.1093/jxb/eri016; Almeida ERA, 2008, CURR GENET, V53, P129, DOI 10.1007/s00294-007-0170-x; Lee PC, 2002, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V60, P1, DOI 10.1007/s00253-002-1101-x; Alvarez-Vasquez F, 2005, NATURE, V433, P425, DOI 10.1038/nature03232; Sandmann G, 2001, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V385, P4, DOI 10.1006/abbi.2000.2170; Xu F, 2007, PROCESS BIOCHEM, V42, P289, DOI 10.1016/j.procbio.2006.08.007; Farmer WR, 2001, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V17, P57, DOI 10.1021/bp000137t; Wang CW, 2000, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V16, P922, DOI 10.1021/bp000124f; Del Campo JA, 2004, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V64, P848, DOI 10.1007/s00253-003-1510-5; Wu ZY, 2007, LETT APPL MICROBIOL, V44, P13, DOI 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02038.x; Del Campo JA, 2007, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V74, P1163, DOI 10.1007/s00253-007-0844-9; Giuliano G, 2008, TRENDS BIOTECHNOL, V26, P139, DOI 10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.12.003; Krinsky NI, 2003, ANNU REV NUTR, V23, P171, DOI 10.1146/annurev.nutr.23.011702.073307; Grima EM, 2003, BIOTECHNOL ADV, V20, P491; Fraser PD, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P1092, DOI 10.1073/pnas.241374598; Lohr M, 2005, PLANT PHYSIOL, V138, P490, DOI 10.1104/pp.104.056069; Kupper H, 2007, ANAL CHEM, V79, P7611, DOI 10.1021/ac070236m; Del Campo JA, 2001, J BIOTECHNOL, V85, P289, DOI 10.1016/S0168-1656(00)00380-1; Shi XM, 2006, MOL NUTR FOOD RES, V50, P763, DOI 10.1002/mnfr.200600037; Wu ZY, 2007, J FOOD PROCESS ENG, V30, P174, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00102.x; Olmedilla B, 2003, NUTRITION, V19, P21, DOI 10.1016/S0899-9007(02)00861-4; BISHOP NI, 1995, FEBS LETT, V367, P158, DOI 10.1016/0014-5793(95)00510-G; BRITTON G, 1995, CAROTENOIDS SPECTROS; Cardinault N, 2003, EXP GERONTOL, V38, P573, DOI 10.1016/S0531-5565(03)00039-1; Iniesta AA, 2007, FEBS J, V274, P4306, DOI 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05960.x; Torres N.

Mycorrhizal networks and complex systems: Contributions of soil ecology science to managing climate change effects in forested ecosystems. Can. J. Soil Sci. 89: 369-382. Soil ecology science has contributed a rich understanding of natural soil patterns and processes, and played a role in revolutionizing the management of ecosystems. This basic understanding is also providing a foundation for predicting and managing the consequences of climate change on ecosystems, including their resilience to disturbance, biotic diversity, and carbon and nutrient dynamics. To help address the challenges of climate change, future soil ecology research and management would benefit from a complex systems approach, where network and dynamics systems theory are used to predict plant community and ecosystem responses to disturbance. A reductionist approach to management that ignores networks and system dynamics, by contrast, is destined to contribute to ecological degradation as climate changes. In this paper, I describe mycorrhizal networks as models of biological networks in the interior Douglas-fir forests of British Columbia, and the role they play in carbon flux and regeneration dynamics following disturbance. I propose a conservationist approach for managing forest mycorrhizal networks and hub trees that can facilitate native plant migrations, limit exotic plant invasions, and bolster ecological resilience. Interdisciplinary research that integrates the dynamics of multiple, overlapping networks will help develop management practices that sustain ecosystems in our changing climate.","Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Simard, SW (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",suzanne.simard@ubc.ca,,,,,"Wolfe Benjamin E., 2009, P167, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-87978-7_12;

This paper explores what complex systems thinking has to offer for commons scholarship by applying these concepts to the pastoral commons of the Gabra ethnic group of north-central Kenya. The concepts of fit and scale can help us to understand why some features of the institutional regime of the Gabra do not conform to mainstream principles such as clearly defined boundaries, clearly defined membership rules, and subsidiarity. The notion of the adaptive renewal cycle can help us to describe and understand some aspects of dynamics of Gabra institutions, especially those related to the management of shallow wells. Applying the adaptive renewal cycle to larger and longer scales highlights the possibility that the Gabra social-ecological system is becoming increasingly brittle, with evolving institutional arrangements putting more and more constraints on adaptation and especially on nomadic mobility. An examination of the distinctive nature of dryland pastoral commons, and in particular a complex systems approach to this examination, suggests a number of issues that relief and development organizations should consider, including how to foster novelty and innovation through all the phases of the adaptive cycle.","Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Robinson, LW (reprint author), Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, 303-70 Dysart Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Lance@roboroz.ca,,,,,"Adger WN, 2000, PROG HUM GEOG, V24, P347, DOI 10.1191/030913200701540465; Dietz T, 2003, SCIENCE, V302, P1907, DOI 10.1126/science.1091015; Folke C, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.002; Holling CS, 2001, ECOSYSTEMS, V4, P390, DOI 10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5; Berkes F, 2006, ECOL SOC, V11; Gunderson LH, 2000, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V31, P425, DOI 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.425; Carpenter S, 2001, ECOSYSTEMS, V4, P765, DOI 10.1007/s10021-001-0045-9; Johnson C, 2004, DEV CHANGE, V35, P407, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-7660.2004.00359.x; Kay JJ, 1999, FUTURES, V31, P721, DOI 10.1016/S0016-3287(99)00029-4; Scoones I, 1999, ANNU REV ANTHROPOL, V28, P479, DOI 10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.479; Berkes F, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P15188, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0702098104; Folke C, 2005, ANNU REV ENV RESOUR, V30, P441, DOI 10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144511; Beck T., 2006, Communities, livelihoods and natural resources: action research and policy change in Asia, P297; BERKES F., 2002, DRAMA COMMONS, P293; BERKES F, 1998, LINKING SOCIAL ECOLO, P2768; BERKES F, 2003, NAVIGATING SOCIAL EC, P2768; CONNELL DJ, 2006, SUST LIV EC HLTH INF, P2768; Cousins B, 2000, EVOLVING LAND RIGHTS, POLICY AND TENURE IN AFRICA, P151; Folke C., 2003, NAVIGATING SOCIAL EC, P352; Ganya C., 2004, POLICY MATTERS, V13, P61; GRANT S, 2006, THESIS U MANITOBA WI, P2768; Gunderson L.

Herein, we explore a genome-wide gene-to-gene regulatory network based on expression data from the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisae (budding yeast). We recover static properties like hubs (genes having several out-going connections), network motifs and modules, which have previously been derived from multiple data sources such as whole-genome expression measurements, literature mining, protein-protein and transcription factor binding data. Further, our analysis uncovers some novel dynamical design principles; hubs are both repressed and repressors, and the intra-modular dynamics are either strongly activating or repressing whereas inter-modular couplings are weak. Finally, taking advantage of the inferred strength and direction of all interactions, we perform a global dynamical systems analysis of the network. Our inferred dynamics of hubs, motifs and modules produce a more stable network than what is expected given randomised versions. The main contribution of the repressed hubs is to increase system stability, while higher order dynamic effects (e.g. module dynamics) mainly increase system flexibility. Altogether, the presence of hubs, motifs and modules induce few flexible modes, to which the network is extra sensitive to an external signal.

Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates, transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait (including possibly negative benefits), and whether individuals disperse locally or randomly. We used generalized linear models to examine how changes in these parameters influence trait extinction, equilibrium prevalence and time to equilibrium. Four traits increased the probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits (although costly traits sometimes reached an equilibrium). Local dispersal and biased transmission mechanisms (prestige and consensus) had no significant effects on extinction probability, and similar patterns were found for equilibrium prevalence. We found that a lower dispersal rate and local dispersal slowed the time required for a trait to reach equilibrium, as did smaller groups, lower transmission rates and lower costs. Collectively, these analyses reveal that prestige and consensus transmission have weaker effects than other factors associated with demographic and social conditions.

What are the conceptual premises of diversity and its management? How do these concepts define identities? How do they decide and influence the entrepreneurial management of these identities? And what patterns of action are typical for diversity conscious organizations? Following these questions by focusing on the discussion of diversity in the German-speaking world, the authors discuss three distinct issues they have had with current diversity management concepts: first, the personalization of social systems; second, the monolithic construction of organizational cultures; and third, an understanding of change that follows a rather mechanistic logic. Trying to light up different blind spots, the article argues for a different approach to diversity management, paying more respect towards organizational dynamics, coping with complexity in a mindful manner, and a sense of ambivalence that should be at the heart of diversity leadership.",,"Eybl, S (reprint author), Veronikagasse 25, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.",sabine.eybl@loop-beratung.at; siegfried.kaltenecker@loop-beratung.at,,,,,"Aretz H.

However, this idea is rapidly changing due to reasons discussed in this study. Many U.S. nuclear power plants are receiving life extensions decades beyond their originally planned lives, which requires the consideration of new risks and uncertainties. This research first investigates those potential risks and sheds light on how nuclear utilities perceive and plan for these risks. After that, it examines the need for systems thinking for extended operation of nuclear reactors in the U.S. Finally, it concludes that U.S. nuclear power plants are good examples of systems in need of change from a traditional managerial view to a systems approach.","[Sireli, A.

In order to isolate the signal and noise due to the direct x-rays from those due to the optical photons, we inserted a light-absorbing blackout material between a phosphor screen and the photodiode array. From the images irradiated with and without the blackout paper, the signal and noise characteristics due to the optical photons emitted from a phosphor screen were estimated. For the analysis of the measurements, we have developed a model describing the signal and noise transfers based on the cascaded linear-systems approach. The measured results show the direct x-ray is very harmful to the detector performances, such noise power spectrum (NPS) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, from the theoretical estimation, the degradation of NPS and SNR would not be due to the directly absorbed x-ray photons, but we believe that other sources, such as Compton and photoelectric scattered rays from a scintillator, a photodiode passivation layer or bulk substrate, are main causes.","[Kim, Ho Kyung; Lim, Chang Hwy; Cho, Min Kook] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Achterkirchen, Thorsten] Rad Icon Imaging Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Cunningham, Ian] Robarts Res Inst, Imaging Res Labs, London, ON N6A 5K8, Canada","Kim, HK (reprint author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",smane1547@pusan.ac.kr; hokyung@pusan.ac.kr; hwy@pusan.ac.kr; mk2000@pusan.ac.kr; achterkirchen@rad-icon.com; icunning@imaging.robarts.ca,"Cunningham, Ian/E-2771-2013",,,,"Shon CS, 2006, KEY ENG MAT, V321-323, P1060; Badano A, 2004, MED PHYS, V31, P3122, DOI 10.1118/1.1796151; [Anonymous], 2007, 6222012 IEC; LUBBERTS G, 1968, J OPT SOC AM, V58, P1475; ROSSMANN K, 1962, J OPT SOC AM, V52, P774, DOI 10.1364/JOSA.52.000774; BOONE JM, 2000, HDB MED IMAGING, V1, P61; Burgess A, 2004, MED PHYS, V31, P1987, DOI 10.1118/1.1758791; Cho MK, 2006, KEY ENG MAT, V321-323, P1052; Graeve T., 2001, Proceedings of the SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, V4320, DOI 10.1117/12.430886; International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2003, 622201 IEC; Kim H K, 2006, APPL PHYS LETT, V89; Kim JM, 2006, KEY ENG MAT, V321-323, P1056; RADCLIFFE T, 1993, MED PHYS, V20, P1161, DOI 10.1118/1.596970; Sattarivand M, 2005, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V24, P211, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2004.839680",14,13,14,0,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",0018-9499,,,IEEE T NUCL SCI,IEEE Trans.

This paper presents an extension of the FasArt model focused on the treatment of temporal signals. FasArt model is proposed as an integration of the characteristic elements of the Fuzzy System Theory in an ART architecture. A duality between the activation concept and membership function is established. FasArt maintains the structure of the Fuzzy ARTMAP architecture, implying a static character since the dynamic response of the input is not considered. The proposed novel model, dynamic FasArt (dFasArt), uses dynamic equations for the processing stages of FasArt: activation, matching and learning. The new formulation of dFasArt includes time as another characteristic of the input. This allows the activation of the units to have a history-dependent character instead of being only a function of the last input value. Therefore, dFasArt model is robust to spurious values and noisy inputs. As experimental work, some cases have been used to check the robustness of dFasArt. A possible application has been proposed for the detection of variations in the system dynamics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects were 30 patients with chronic MLBP (age: 41.1 +/- 8.9 years, body mass index: 26.2 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)) and 35 asymptomatic controls (age: 38.8 +/- 9.2 years. body mass index: 25.3 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2)). Kinematic data were collected from the femur, pelvis and lumbar spine during repeated trials of bilateral forward reaching under two loading conditions. Sagittal plane angular motion was filtered and time normalized. Continuous relative phases were then calculated for each data point. Mean absolute relative phase (MARP) and deviation phase (DIP) parameters were derived to quantify intersegmental coordination and pattern variability. Mixed-model ANOVAs revealed that lumbo-pelvic coordination was more separated in time and more variable in the chronic MLBP group during this task. Trunk neuromuscular control was thus altered in our MLBP group. Unresolved extensor muscle dysfunction is suggested by (a) preliminary analysis of phase plane trajectories, (b) subjects' greater difficulty controlling aspects of the task that required the extensors to contribute to trunk stability and primary movement control.

Current research in the field of business and information systems engineering (BISE), however, is primarily technology-or practice-oriented and concerned with the construction and validation of prototypes, whereas little attention is paid to theoretical insights into organizational phenomena and relationships. In this paper, we argue that paying more attention to organization theory would provide valuable guidance in addressing the close links between ICS on the one hand, and organizational systems on the other.

In future, risks will escalate as a consequence of climate change effects and continued population growth. Strategies which seek to reduce the per capita demand for water, and ideally to limit total consumption, appear to be obvious ways of achieving water resource sustainability. Programs which focus on improving the effectiveness in communicating to consumers how water availability is threatened are considered to be an essential part managing demand and ultimately consumption. Effective communication aims to increase public understanding of the problem whilst better informing local decision making and public acceptance of strategies which might be imposed in future to manage scarce water resources. As this problem is inherently complex, effective risk communication is problematic both for those developing management strategies and those who may have such strategies imposed upon them. Advances in computer modelling and simulation, supported by rapid progress in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) provide unprecedented opportunities for demonstrating to the public the complex interrelationships between supply and demand for water. System Dynamics (SD) modelling is a promising approach for enabling learning and communication. While SD is often used to analyse the dynamics of systemic problems and assess policy options, its potential for communicating systemic risks to the public has not been fully exploited. The ongoing research described in this paper aims to develop a SD-based interactive learning tool to help ACT residents develop a systemic perspective of the water management problem and to demonstrate plausible futures they might face. Expected outcomes of this research are an understanding of options for facilitating dialogue among stakeholders, effectively promoting waterwise attitudes and ultimately influencing consumer behaviour. This paper describes the methodology used to collect, analyse and merge views elicited from stakeholders (i. e. users and managers) and to form them into a conceptual causal feedback representation of the problem. This representation forms the basis for subsequent stages in which quantitative models and computer simulations will be developed. The methodology has three stages. Firstly, a preliminary conceptual model was developed based on the systems thinking (ST) and SD literatures. Secondly, local and expert knowledge was captured by eliciting the perceptions of water users (n= 25) and managers (n= 10) in the ACT using semi-structured interviews. Cognitive Mapping techniques were used to depict participants' perceptions. Finally, noting the potential pitfalls of doing so, the various views were represented in a single conceptual model. An electronic workbook was also used to investigate stakeholders' perceptions of the causal relationships between selected strongly coupled variables and for obtaining estimates of selected parameters needed for subsequent quantitative modelling activities. The ST/SD modelling used in this research is distinguished by the following: as an action research inquiry and that it seeks to demonstrate the recoverability criterion. That is, whilst it is neither possible to comprehensively validate the research findings nor precisely replicate the research elsewhere, every step in the research journey is traceable. Hence understanding of problem and the manifestations of its complexity are enhanced as are the insights into how to develop and implement effective risk communication strategies.","[El Sawah, Sondoss; Mclucas, Alan; Mazanov, Jason] Univ New S Wales, Australian Def Force Acad, Canberra, ACT, Australia","El Sawah, S (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Australian Def Force Acad, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",s.elsawah@student.adfa..edu.au,,,,,"Ackermann F., 1998, MAKING STRATEGY JOUR; *ACT GOV, 2004, THINK WATER ACT WAT, V1; Stave KA, 2003, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V67, P303, DOI 10.1016/S0301-4797(02)00205-0; Garvin T, 2001, RISK ANAL, V21, P443, DOI 10.1111/0272-4332.213124; Checkland P, 1998, SYST PRACT ACT RES, V11, P9, DOI 10.1023/A:1022908820784; Elshorbagy A, 2007, HYDROLOG SCI J, V52, P538, DOI 10.1623/hysj.52.3.538; Hjorth P, 2006, FUTURES, V38, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.futures.2005.04.005; Luna-Reyes LF, 2003, SYST DYNAM REV, V19, P271, DOI 10.1002/sdr.280; Stave KA, 2002, SYST DYNAM REV, V18, P139, DOI 10.1002/sdr.237; Tidwell VC, 2004, AQUAT SCI, V66, P357, DOI 10.1007/s00027-004-0722-9; Ford DN, 1998, SYST DYNAM REV, V14, P309, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199824)14:4<309::AID-SDR154>3.0.CO;2-5; Howick S, 2008, EUR J OPER RES, V186, P1068, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2007.02.027; Cooper M, 2007, NEXT STEPS ENSURE WA; Coyle RG, 1996, SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODE; Dietz T., 2002, NEW TOOLS ENV PROTEC; Fazey I, 2006, ECOL SOC, V11; FORRESTER JW, 1992, EUR J OPER RES, V59, P42, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(92)90006-U; McLucas A.

Brownfields exist in very large numbers and pose serious environmental and health risks in developed countries around the world. As industries abandon unprofitable sites and development spreads to other parts of the globe, potential brownfield creation abounds which will further exacerbate the problem. Preventing the creation of brownfields in the first place should be a priority. However, it will depend on the availability of options (technology) and the incentives to implement them (policy). A retrospective look at the City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, shows that a $10,000 investment in prevention could have avoided $100,000+ of cleanup cost on former gas station sites. Similarly, leaking underground fuel tanks could be prevented in South Sudan with double-walled tanks and appropriate procedures for less than 2% of the cost of cleaning up fuel leaks. Additional health-related economic and social costs associated with consumption of hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater could also be avoided. Actual implementation of pollution prevention requires a systems approach. Our research focuses on enhancing the relationship between engineering and policymaking through systems thinking and providing practical decision making support tools to guide development in a sustainable manner.","[Taylor, Bruce; Hipel, Lloyd] Enviro Stewards Engineers & Scientists, Elmira, ON, Canada","Taylor, B (reprint author), Enviro Stewards Engineers & Scientists, Elmira, ON, Canada.",btaylor@enviro-stewards.com; lhipel@enviro-stewards.com; kwhipel@uwaterloo.ca; lfang@ryerson.ca; mtheng@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,"ALEXANDER DE, 1994, CONTAMINANTS ENV, P263; Chen Y, 2009, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V24, P647, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2008.10.011; Litt JS, 2002, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V110, P183; Taylor B, 2006, J CLEAN PROD, V14, P601, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2005.07.013; BROWNER CM, 1993, EPA J            JUL; *CAN COUNC MIN ENV, 1993, CCMEEPC75E; Carlon Claudio, 2009, P113, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-09722-0_6; *CCME, 2003, ENV COD PRACT AB UND; De Sousa CA, 2004, J ENVIRON PLANN MAN, V47, P579, DOI 10.1080/0964056042000243249; FRANCIS G, 2006, INTEGRATED ASSESSMEN, V6, P59; *GOV CAN, NAT POLL REL INV; GRANEK F, 2009, COMMUNICATION   0421; Hipel K.

formal verification; systems engineering; time Petri nets; timed bisimulation,TIME PETRI NETS,"Safety analysis in systems engineering (SE) processes, as usually implemented, rarely relies on formal methods such as model checking since such techniques, however powerful and mature, are deemed too complex for efficient use. This paper thus aims at improving the verification practice in SE design: considering the widely-used model of enhanced function flow block diagrams (EFFBDs), it formally establishes its syntax and behavioral semantics. It also proposes a structural translation of EFFBDs to transition time Petri nets (TPNs); this translation is then proved to preserve the behavioral semantics (i.e., timed bisimilarity). After proving results on the boundedness of the resulting TPNs, it was possible to extend a number of fundamental properties (such as the decidability of liveness, state-access, etc.) from bounded TPNs to so-called bounded EFFBDs. Finally, these results led to both implementing and integrating a formal verification tool within a development platform for system design for defense applications and in which the underlying complexity is totally concealed from the end-user.","[Seidner, Charlotte; Roux, Olivier H.] IRCCyN, Real Time Syst, F-44321 Nantes 3, France","Seidner, C (reprint author), IRCCyN, Real Time Syst, F-44321 Nantes 3, France.",,,,,,"ALUR R, 1994, THEORETICAL COMPUTER, V126, P235; ALUR R, 1990, INT S LOG COMP SCI, V5, P414; Cassez F, 2006, J SYST SOFTWARE, V79, P1456, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2005.12.021; LAMPORT L, 1977, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V3, P125, DOI 10.1109/TSE.1977.229904; Gardey G, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3576, P418; Berard B, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3707, P293; BERNARDI S, 2007, WOSP 07, P115; Berthomieu B., 1983, P 9 INT FED INF PROC, V9, P41; BONDAVALLI A, 2001, J COMPUTER SYSTEMS S, V16, P265; GARDEY G, 2006, THESIS U NANTES NANT; HENZINGER TA, 1992, LECT NOTES COMPUTER; HERZOG E, 2004, THESIS LINKOPINGS U; *IEEE, 1994, IEEE1220; INCOSE, 2004, WHAT IS SYST ENG; LONG J, 1995, P 5 INT S INCOSE ST; Merlin P., 1974, THESIS U CALIFORNIA; *NCOSE TECHN BOARD, 2004, INCOSE SYST ENG HDB; *OBJ MAN GROUP SYS, 2007, OMG SYST MOD LANG OM; PARK D, 1981, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V104; RUGINA AE, 2005, RENCONTRES JEUNES CH; *SAE AER, 2004, 5506 SAE AS; SEIDNER C, 2007, R120073 IRCCYN; SEIDNER C, 2008, P 18 INT S INCOSE UT; SEIDNER C, 2007, P 17 INT S INT COUNC; *US AIR FORC, 1968, MILSTD499 US AIR FOR; VANDEPERREN Y, 2005, P 2 UML SOC WORKSH 4",26,6,7,1,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",1551-3203,,,IEEE T IND INFORM,IEEE Trans.

The analysis builds on the Strategic Value Assessment Model (Fine, et al. [Fine, Charles H., Vardan, Roger, Pethick, Robert, El Hout, Jamal. Rapid-Response Capability in value chain Design. MIT Sloan Manage Rev 2002, 43(Winter): 69-75.]) and utilizes a qualitative System Dynamics mapping approach. The map focuses on the driving forces affecting user adoption of 3G services, focusing on customer dynamics, competitive dynamics, and technology dynamics. To analyze adoption of 3G services by customers, the articles maps the dynamics of (1) network investment and user population, (2) entry of service innovators as well as price competitors, (3) the effects of positive network externalities arising from a larger user population, (4) price compression as lower willingness-to-pay users adopt 3G services, (5) scale economies in terminal costs and prices, and (6) new content development as a draw to new users. Applying inductive systems diagrams hypotheses are integrated into a causal loop map and tested with data collected at 15 communications-industry workshops attended by 190 participants in Europe. The map aims to deepen the understanding of the possible evolutionary paths of the 3G wireless value network. The article seeks also to assess which future scenarios are plausible and what dynamic triggers might make them likely. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These new families were coined with the resolvins and protectins because they possess potent bioactions and novel chemical structures. The mapping of these new resolution circuits has already provided new avenues for appreciating the molecular basis of many inflammatory diseases. This presentation/mini review gives recent advances from our studies on resolvin and protectin biosynthesis and the actions of these novel mediators. These previously unappreciated families of lipid-derived mediators were originally isolated from murine models of acute inflammation captured during the natural spontaneous resolution phase. They are biosynthesized from omega-3 fatty acids and possess potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving and anti-fibrotic in vivo actions. These new families of endogenous pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory agonists were also used as biotemplates to design potent mimetics/analogs which were used to confirm each of their structures and specific functions. Moreover, together the identification of these mediators indicate that resolution is an active process at the tissue level in vivo as well as constitute a new genus of anti-inflammatories with a previously unknown pro-resolving mechanism of action.

To measure the effectiveness of an industrial systems-engineering approach to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention program. DESIGN. Before-after intervention study SETTING. An intensive care unit (ICU) and a surgical unit that was not an ICU in the Pittsburgh Veterans Administration hospital PATIENTS. All patients admitted to the study units INTERVENTION. We implemented an MRSA infection control program that consisted of the following 4 elements: ( 1) the use of standard precautions for all patient contact, with emphasis on hand hygiene; ( 2) the use of contact precautions for interactions with patients known to be infected or colonized with MRSA; ( 3) the use of active surveillance cultures to identify patients who were asymptomatically colonized with MRSA; and ( 4) use of an industrial systems-engineering approach, the Toyota Production System, to facilitate consistent and reliable adherence to the infection control program. RESULTS. The rate of healthcare-associated MRSA infection in the surgical unit decreased from 1.56 infections per 1,000 patient-days in the 2 years before the intervention to 0.63 infections per 1,000 patient-days in the 4 years after the intervention (a 60% reduction; P = . 003). The rate of healthcare-associated MRSA infection in the ICU decreased from 5.45 infections per 1,000 patient-days in the 2 years before to the intervention to 1.35 infections per 1,000 patient-days in the 3 years after the intervention (a 75% reduction; P = .001). The combined estimate for reduction in the incidence of infection after the intervention in the 2 units was 68% (95% confidence interval, 50%-79%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS. Sustained reduction in the incidence of MRSA infection is possible in a setting where this pathogen is endemic. An industrial systems-engineering approach can be adapted to facilitate consistent and reliable adherence to MRSA infection prevention practices in healthcare facilities.","[Muder, Robert R.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Infect Dis Sect, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA; [Muder, Robert R.; Jain, Rajiv] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh Reg Healthcare Initiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Perreiah, Peter] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Sinkowitz-Cochran, Ronda L.; Jernigan, John A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Healthcare Qual Promot, Atlanta, GA USA","Muder, RR (reprint author), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Infect Dis Sect, Univ Dr C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA.",Robert.Muder@va.gov,,,,,"Jernigan JA, 1996, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V143, P496; HALEY RW, 1995, J INFECT DIS, V171, P614; Melzer M, 2003, CLIN INFECT DIS, V37, P1453, DOI 10.1086/379321; Kim PW, 2003, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V31, P97, DOI 10.1067/mic.2003.32; Abramson MA, 1999, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V20, P408, DOI 10.1086/501641; Blot SI, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P2229, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.19.2229; Cosgrove SE, 2005, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V26, P166, DOI 10.1086/502522; Muto CA, 2003, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V24, P362, DOI 10.1086/502213; Klevens RM, 2006, CLIN INFECT DIS, V42, P389, DOI 10.1086/499367; Manian FA, 2003, CLIN INFECT DIS, V36, P863, DOI 10.1086/368195; Engemann JJ, 2003, CLIN INFECT DIS, V36, P592, DOI 10.1086/367653; Pittet D, 1999, ANN INTERN MED, V130, P126; Jernigan JA, 1995, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V16, P686; Afif W, 2002, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V30, P430, DOI 10.1067/mic.2002.125174; PETTINGER A, 1991, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V12, P303; Cooper BS, 2004, BRIT MED J, V329, P533, DOI 10.1136/bmj.329.7465.533; Cosgrove SE, 2003, CLIN INFECT DIS, V36, P53, DOI 10.1086/345476; Whitby M, 2001, MED J AUSTRALIA, V175, P264; Mangram AJ, 1999, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V20, P250, DOI 10.1086/501620; GARNER JS, 1988, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V16, P128, DOI 10.1016/0196-6553(88)90053-3; Boyce JM, 2002, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V23, pS3, DOI 10.1086/503164; Cleveland W.S., 1991, STAT COMPUT, V1, P47, DOI 10.1007/bf01890836; Farr BM, 2004, CURR OPIN INFECT DIS, V17, P317, DOI 10.1097/01.qco.0000136926.52673.cd; Garner Julia S., 1996, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, V17, P53; Jernigan JA, 2004, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V25, P457, DOI 10.1086/502421; Kotilainen P, 2003, EMERG INFECT DIS, V9, P169; MURRAYLEISURE KA, 1990, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V11, P343; Nicolle LE, 1999, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V20, P202, DOI 10.1086/501613; Siegel JD, 2006, MANAGEMENT MULTIDRUG; Spear S., 1999, HARVARD BUS REV, V77, P97; Struelens MJ, 1996, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V17, P503",31,33,33,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0899-823X,,,INFECT CONT HOSP EP,Infect.

These electrochemical devices are most beneficial when used in hybrid configurations rather than as individual components. A system model helps us to understand the interactions between components and enables us to determine the response of the system as a whole. However, system models that are available predict just the performance and neglect degradation. The objective of this research is to provide a framework to account for the durability phenomena that are prevalent in fuel cells and batteries in a hybrid system. Toward this end, the methodology for development of surrogate models is provided, and Pt catalyst dissolution in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is used as an example to demonstrate the approach. Surrogate models are more easily integrated into higher level system models than the detailed physics-based models. As an illustration, the effects of changes in control strategies and power management approaches in mitigating platinum instability in fuel cells are reported. A system model that includes a fuel cell stack, a storage battery, power-sharing algorithm, and dc/dc converter has been developed; and preliminary results have been presented. These results show that platinum stability can be improved with only a small impact on system efficiency. Thus, this research will elucidate the importance of degradation issues in system design and optimization as opposed to just initial performance metrics. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An explicit systems perspective is needed in which putative mechanisms of how brain function is constrained by brain structure are mathematically formalized and made accessible for experimental investigation. Such a systems approach critically rests on a better understanding of brain connectivity, in its various forms. Since 2002, frontier topics of connectivity and neural system analysis have been discussed in a multidisciplinary annual meeting, the Brain Connectivity Workshop (BCW), bringing together experimentalists and theorists from various fields. This article summarizes some of the main discussions at the two most recent workshops, 2006 at Sendai, Japan, and 2007 at Barcelona, Spain: (i) investigation of cortical micro- and macrocircuits, (ii) models of neural dynamics at multiple scales, (iii) analysis of ""resting state"" networks, and (iv) linking anatomical to functional connectivity. Finally, we outline some central challenges and research trajectories in computational systems neuroscience for the next years. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to investigate whether-and under what conditions-disease-related mortality can impact rates of pathogen spread in populations of polygynous groups. Specifically, we investigated whether pathogen-mediated dispersal (PMD) can occur when females disperse after the resident male dies from disease, thus carrying infections to new groups. We also examined the effects of incubation period and virulence, host mortality and rates of background dispersal, and we used the model to investigate the spread of the virus responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which currently is devastating African ape populations. Output was analyzed using regression trees, which enable exploration of hierarchical and non-linear relationships. Analyses revealed that the incidence of disease in single-male (polygynous) groups was significantly greater for those groups containing an average of more than six females, while the total number of infected hosts in the population was most sensitive to the number of females per group. Thus, as expected, PMD occurs in polygynous groups and its effects increase as harem size (the number of females) increases. Simulation output further indicated that population-level effects of Ebola are likely to differ among multi-male-multi-female chimpanzees and polygynous gorillas, with larger overall numbers of chimpanzees infected, but more gorilla groups becoming infected due to increased dispersal when the resident male dies. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of social system on the spread of disease in wild mammals.","[Nunn, Charles L.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Nunn, Charles L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA;

Rarely it is thought that an increased control of the system can lead to a looser response and, therefore, to a poorer performance. Strikingly there are many systems that show this weird behavior; examples can be drawn form physical, biological, and social systems. Until now no simple and general mechanism underlying such behaviors has been identified. Here we show that such a mechanism, named stochastic resonant damping, can be,provided by the interplay between the background noise and the control exerted on the system. We experimentally verify our prediction on a physical model system based on a colloidal particle held in an oscillating optical potential. Our result adds a tool for the study of intrinsically noisy phenomena, joining the many constructive facets of noise identified in the past decades-for example, stochastic resonance, noise-induced activation; and Brownian ratchets.","[Volpe, Giovanni; Perrone, Sandro; Petrov, Dmitri] ICFO Inst Ciencies Foton, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Rubi, J.

We tackle this challenge here through the parameterization of S-system models. It was previously shown that parameter identification can be performed as an optimization based on the decoupling of the differential S-system equations, which results in a set of algebraic equations. Results: A novel parameterization solution is proposed for the identification of S-system models from time series when no information about the network topology is known. The method is based on eigenvector optimization of a matrix formed from multiple regression equations of the linearized decoupled S-system. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the optimization of network topologies with constraints on metabolites and fluxes. These constraints rejoin the system in cases where it had been fragmented by decoupling. We demonstrate with synthetic time series why the algorithm can be expected to converge in most cases. Conclusion: A procedure was developed that facilitates automated reverse engineering tasks for biological networks using S-systems. The proposed method of eigenvector optimization constitutes an advancement over S-system parameter identification from time series using a recent method called Alternating Regression. The proposed method overcomes convergence issues encountered in alternate regression by identifying nonlinear constraints that restrict the search space to computationally feasible solutions. Because the parameter identification is still performed for each metabolite separately, the modularity and linear time characteristics of the alternating regression method are preserved. Simulation studies illustrate how the proposed algorithm identifies the correct network topology out of a collection of models which all fit the dynamical time series essentially equally well.","[Vilela, Marco; Almeida, Jonas S.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chou, I-Chun; Voit, Eberhard O.] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chou, I-Chun; Voit, Eberhard O.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Vinga, Susana] INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza R.] Lab Nacl Computacao Cient, Dept Computatinal & Appl Math, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Vilela, Marco; Almeida, Jonas S.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal","Vilela, M (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mvilela@mdanderson.org; bigjump@gatech.edu; svinga@kdbio.inesc-id.pt; atrv@lncc.br; eberhard.voit@bme.gatech.edu; jalmeida@mdanderson.org,"Vinga, Susana/B-8450-2008; Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza/I-1011-2012","Vinga, Susana/0000-0002-1954-5487; Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza/0000-0002-4632-2086",,,"Almeida Jonas S, 2003, Genome Inform, V14, P114; Kutalik Z, 2007, IET SYST BIOL, V1, P174, DOI 10.1049/iet-syb:20060064; Sugimoto M, 2005, BIOSYSTEMS, V80, P155, DOI 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.11.003; SAVAGEAU MA, 1969, J THEOR BIOL, V25, P365, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5193(69)80026-3; Voit E, 2006, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V103, P9452, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0603337103; Voit EO, 2004, BIOINFORMATICS, V20, P1670, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth140; Gutenkunst RN, 2007, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V3, P1871, DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030189; Tsai KY, 2005, BIOINFORMATICS, V21, P1180, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti099; SAVAGEAU MA, 1969, J THEOR BIOL, V25, P370, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5193(69)80027-5; Sands PJ, 1996, ECOL MODEL, V93, P75, DOI 10.1016/0304-3800(95)00215-4; Gonzalez OR, 2007, BIOINFORMATICS, V23, P480, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl522; Kikuchi S, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P643, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg027; SAVAGEAU MA, 1970, J THEOR BIOL, V26, P215, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5193(70)80013-3; Hlavacek WS, 1996, J MOL BIOL, V255, P121, DOI 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0011; Berg PH, 1996, B MATH BIOL, V58, P923; BOS A, 1980, AUTOMATICA, V16, P487; Chou IC, 2006, THEOR BIOL MED MODEL, V3, DOI 10.1186/1742-4682-3-25; JORGE JM, 1981, TESTING UNCONSTRAINE, V7, P17; MAGNUS JR, 1988, WILEY SERIES PROBABI, V17; Maki Y., 2002, GENOME INFORMATICS, V13, P382; Matsubara Y, 2006, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V7, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-7-230; Polisetty PK, 2006, THEOR BIOL MED MODEL, V3, DOI 10.1186/1742-4682-3-4; UEDA NM, 2003, GENOME INFORMATICS, V14, P282; UEDA NM, 2004, GENOME INFORMATICS; Ueda T., 2002, GENOME INFORMATICS, V13, P386; Vilela M, 2007, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V8, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-8-305; VOIT EO, 1992, MATH BIOSCI, V109, P19, DOI 10.1016/0025-5564(92)90050-7; VOIT EO, 1982, J FERMENT TECHNOL, V60, P233; VOIT EO, 2000, COMPUTATIONAL ANAL B, V12",29,39,40,1,10,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1752-0509,,,BMC SYST BIOL,BMC Syst.

This approach allows the overall complexity of the comprehensive system to be broken down into smaller manageable subunits that are easier to visualize. Quantitative interactions among nutrients supplied and metabolic production processes can be observed over extended time periods. Using Molly, undergraduate animal science students are able to observe detailed effects of changing dietary inputs, altering genetic milk production potential, and exogenously manipulating metabolism on metabolism of the whole cow. This paper demonstrates how Molly is used in the classroom to teach a systems approach to nutrition using example simulations. Three simulation examples demonstrate exercises examining effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin administration, dietary protein, and amino acid supplementation and nitrogen efficiency on milk production and cow metabolism. These and similar examples have been used to teach nutrition, metabolism, and lactation to undergraduate students for the past 20 yr.","[Johnson, H. A.; Calvert, C. C.; Baldwin, R.

Based on fuzzy partition of the input space, two new sufficient conditions under which the closed-loop T-S fuzzy control system is asymptotically stable in the large were obtained by constructing piecewise smooth Lyapunov function. The new sufficient conditions, which only required finding a common positive definite matrix and a positive semi-definite matrix in each subspace, reduced the conservatism and difficulty of the former stability conditions since the structural information of the premises and the interactions among the local subsystems were utilized sufficiently. The comparison of the relationships among the stability conditions we proposed was concluded in a rigorous manner. Utilizing parallel distributed compensation (PDC) principle and linear system theory, a systematic design method of T-S fuzzy controller was investigated and a resulting T-S fuzzy controller of ship lift feedback fin was applied to the original nonlinear model of ship rolling movement. The computer simulation demonstrates the validity and superiority of the proposed systematic design method and the stability conditions.","[Wang, Ning] Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Marine Engn, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China","Wang, N (reprint author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Marine Engn, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.",,"Wang, Ning/B-2777-2012","Wang, Ning/0000-0003-1745-1425",,,"Xiu ZH, 2005, FUZZY SET SYST, V151, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.fss.2004.04.008; Feng G, 2004, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V12, P22, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2003.819833; Kim E, 2000, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V8, P523; Tanaka K, 1998, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V6, P250, DOI 10.1109/91.669023; Teixeira MCM, 1999, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V7, P133, DOI 10.1109/91.755395; Johansson M, 1999, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V7, P713, DOI 10.1109/91.811241; Cao SG, 1996, INT J SYST SCI, V27, P193, DOI 10.1080/00207729608929204; Cao SG, 1997, INT J SYST SCI, V28, P397, DOI 10.1080/00207729708929400; Feng G, 2004, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V34, P283, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2003.811500; TAKAGI T, 1985, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V15, P116; Tanaka K, 1996, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V4, P1, DOI 10.1109/91.481840; Wang HO, 1996, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V4, P14, DOI 10.1109/91.481841",12,1,1,4,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-2113-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,1223,1228,,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BIJ02,WOS:000259965700229,B,"Deicke, F; Gratz, H; Fischer, WJ",,,IEEE,"Deicke, Frank; Graetz, Hagen; Fischer, Wolf-Joachim",,,Combined system analysis and automated design of RFID transponder systems,2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID,,,English,Proceedings Paper,2nd IEEE International Conference on RFID,"APR 16-17, 2008","Las Vegas, NV","Int Busniess Assoc, RFID Tribe, Region 6, IEEE Commun Soc, Consumer Electron Soc, IEEE Electron Devices Soc, IEEE Instrument & Measurement Soc, Reliabil Soc, Syst Man & Cybernet Soc",,,,"RFID transponder systems including ID and sensor functionality conquer more and more new application areas. Especially passive transponders with integrated sensors represent miniaturized and autonomous functionalities. That can be used in industry for process monitoring or automation. Just as well complex and implantable diagnostic systems are available in e.g. medical engineering using that technology. Considering these manifold usage scenarios and considering different specifications on performance and capabilities a customized configuration of the transponder system is necessary. In this connection often used approximated or closed formulas for system design do not meet the requirements of accuracy for most cases. Furthermore, searching for an optimized system solution is often impossible. On the other hand numerical toots using e.g. FEM are well known. But automated system optimization can only be done partly and with big efforts. Considering that, this paper focuses on methods for a combined system analysis and an automated design of RFID transponder systems to open up that bottleneck. The most important goal of the presented methods is a high efficiency and a sufficient accuracy. That is necessary to consider field models and electrical circuit models concurrently and to find an optimal solution within an adequate amount of time. The methods are brought together in a new software toot called TransCal. It could be an interesting approach to design the transmission channel, to optimize the antennas and to integrate it into the whole system.","[Deicke, Frank; Graetz, Hagen] Fraunhofer Inst Photon Microsyst, Dresden, Germany","Deicke, F (reprint author), Fraunhofer Inst Photon Microsyst, Dresden, Germany.",,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2009, ANSYS 11 0 US MAN; DEICKE PF, 2006, WIR C 2006 NOV; FERREIRA JA, 1994, IEEE T POWER ELE JAN; Finkenzeller K, 2002, RFID HDB; *FRAUNH IPMS, 2003, IPMS IF14443 DAT; *FRAUNH IPMS, 2007, STI DAT; GRAETZ H, 2007, MST K 2007 OCT; Grover F.

Because various parameters of the same system could have drastically different ranges from 10(-15) to 1010, the ODEs can be stiff and ill-conditioned, resulting in non-unique, non-existing, or non-reproducible modeling solutions. Previous studies have not examined in depth how to best select numerical solvers for biomolecular system models, which makes it difficult to experimentally validate the modeling results. To address this problem, we have chosen one of the well-known stiff initial value problems with limit cycle behavior as a test-bed system model. Solving this model, we have illustrated that different answers may result from different numerical solvers. We use MATLAB numerical solvers because they are optimized and widely used by the modeling community. We have also conducted a systematic study of numerical solver performances by using qualitative and quantitative measures such as convergence, accuracy, and computational cost (i.e. in terms of function evaluation, partial derivative, LU decomposition, and ""take-off"" points). The results show that the modeling solutions can be drastically different using different numerical solvers. Thus, it is important to intelligently select numerical solvers when solving biomolecular system models. Results: The classic Belousov-Zhabotinskii (BZ) reaction is described by the Oregonator model and is used as a case study. We report two guidelines in selecting optimal numerical solver(s) for stiff, complex oscillatory systems: (i) for problems with unknown parameters, ode45 is the optimal choice regardless of the relative error tolerance; (ii) for known stiff problems, both ode113 and ode15s are good choices under strict relative tolerance conditions. Conclusions: For any given biomolecular model, by building a library of numerical solvers with quantitative performance assessment metric, we show that it is possible to improve reliability of the analytical modeling, which in turn can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of experimental validations of these models. Also, our study can be extended to study a variety of molecular-level system models for human disease diagnosis and therapeutic treatment.","[Quo, Chang F.; Wang, May D.] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Quo, Chang F.; Wang, May D.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Wang, May D.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Wang, May D.] Emory Univ, Winship Canc Inst, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Wang, May D.] Georgia Inst Technol, Parker H Petit Inst Bioengn & Biosci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Wang, MD (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",gtg801f@mail.gatech.edu; maywang@bme.gatech.edu,,,,,"Hendriks BS, 2003, J BIOL CHEM, V278, P23343, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M300477200; FIELD RJ, 1974, J CHEM PHYS, V60, P1877, DOI 10.1063/1.1681288; Shampine LF, 1999, SIAM REV, V41, P538, DOI 10.1137/S003614459933425X; TYSON JJ, 1977, J CHEM PHYS, V66, P905, DOI 10.1063/1.433997; FIELD RJ, 1972, J AM CHEM SOC, V94, P8649, DOI 10.1021/ja00780a001; LARTER R, 1987, J CHEM PHYS, V87, P5765, DOI 10.1063/1.453550; FITZHUGH R, 1960, J GEN PHYSIOL, V43, P867, DOI 10.1085/jgp.43.5.867; FIELD RJ, 1972, NATURE, V237, P390, DOI 10.1038/237390a0; Atkinson K.

Based on flow cytometric and gene expression analysis, these cells have been shown to express several markers of embryonic stem cells and were accordingly termed Very Small Embryonic-Like stem cells (VSELs). In order to better characterize VSELs, we focused on their morphological parameters (e.g. diameter, nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, cytoplasmic area) as well as expression of Oct-4. To examine the morphological features of VSELs, we employed a multi-dimensional approach, including (i) traditional flow cytometry, (ii) a novel approach, which is ImageStream (IS) cytometry and (iii) confocal microscopy. We demonstrate by all of the sensitive and precise methods employed, that VSELs are a population of very small cells, which are significantly smaller than haematopoetic stem cells (HSC) (3.63 +/- 0.09 versus 6.54 +/- 0.17 mu m in diameter). They also exhibit higher nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and lower cytoplasmic area as compared with HSCs and mature granulocytes. Besides confirming the size characteristics, confocal microscopic analysis also confirmed that VSELs express Oct-4, a marker of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Morphological examination reveals that VSELs are unusually small eukaryotic cells that posses several characteristics of embryonic cells. Thus, FACS-based sorting strategies should consider that adult tissues harbour small primitive cells that are larger than platelets and smaller than erythrocytes.","[Zuba-Surma, Ewa K.; Kucia, Magdalena; Ratajczak, Mariusz Z.] Univ Louisville, James Graham Brown Canc Ctr, Stem Cell Biol Inst, Louisville, KY 40202 USA; [Abdel-Latif, Ahmed; Dawn, Buddhadeb] Univ Louisville, Inst Mol Cardiol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Hall, Brian] Amnis Corp, Seattle, WA 98121 USA; [Singh, Rajesh; Lillard, James W., Jr.] Univ Louisville, James Graham Brown Canc Ctr, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Ratajczak, MZ (reprint author), Univ Louisville, James Graham Brown Canc Ctr, Stem Cell Biol Inst, 500 Floyd St, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",ekzuba01@louisville.edu; mzrata01@louisville.edu,"Kucia, Magdalena/O-8058-2014; Ratajczak, Mariusz Zdzislaw/N-1599-2014",,,,"Baal N, 2004, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V92, P767, DOI 10.1160/TH04-02-0079; Scheffler B, 2005, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V102, P9353, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0503965102; Ortyn WE, 2006, CYTOM PART A, V69A, P852, DOI 10.1002/cyto.a.20306; Kucia M, 2006, LEUKEMIA, V20, P857, DOI 10.1038/sj.leu.2404171; Singh SK, 2003, CANCER RES, V63, P5821; Teodori L, 2006, CYTOM PART A, V69A, P75, DOI 10.1002/cyto.a.20208; Hung SC, 2002, STEM CELLS, V20, P249, DOI 10.1634/stemcells.20-3-249; Kucia M, 2005, BIOL CELL, V97, P133, DOI 10.1042/BC20040069; De Paiva CS, 2006, STEM CELLS, V24, P368, DOI 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0148; Darzynkiewicz Z, 1999, EXP CELL RES, V249, P1, DOI 10.1006/excr.1999.4477; Chen WS, 2007, EXP EYE RES, V84, P626, DOI 10.1016/j.exer.2006.11.006; Vacanti MP, 2001, J CELL BIOCHEM, V80, P455, DOI 10.1002/1097-4644(20010301)80:3<455::AID-JCB180>3.0.CO;2-Z; Redvers RP, 2006, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V103, P13168, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0602579103; Ratajczak MZ, 2007, LEUKEMIA, V21, P860, DOI 10.1038/sj.leu.2404630; Ricci-Vitiani L, 2007, NATURE, V445, P111, DOI 10.1038/nature05384; Bedner E, 1999, CYTOMETRY, V35, P181, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990301)35:3<181::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-5; LATIMER P, 1979, BIOPHYS J, V27, P117; George TC, 2006, J IMMUNOL METHODS, V311, P117, DOI 10.1016/j.jim.2006.01.018; Kucia M, 2004, BLOOD CELL MOL DIS, V32, P52, DOI 10.1016/j.bcmd.2003.09.025; Romano AC, 2003, INVEST OPHTH VIS SCI, V44, P5125, DOI 10.1167/iovs.03-0628; Kucia M, 2007, LEUKEMIA, V21, P297, DOI 10.1038/sj.leu.2404470; George TC, 2004, CYTOM PART A, V59A, P237, DOI 10.1002/cyto.a.20048; Xiao JC, 2004, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V10, P1208; Kucia M, 2004, CIRC RES, V95, P1191, DOI 10.1161/01.RES.0000150856.47324.5b; Kamentsky LA, 1997, ACTA CYTOL, V41, P123; Kucia M, 2005, EXP HEMATOL, V33, P613, DOI 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.01.016; O'Brien CA, 2007, NATURE, V445, P106, DOI 10.1038/nature05372; Darzynkiewicz Zbigniew, 2006, Methods Mol Biol, V314, P81; Deptala A, 2001, FOLIA HISTOCHEM CYTO, V39, P87; Glisic-Milosavljevic S, 2005, CELL PROLIFERAT, V38, P301, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2005.00351.x; He ZP, 2004, CELL PROLIFERAT, V37, P177, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2004.00293.x; Howell JC, 2003, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V996, P158; Kamentsky LA, 2001, METHOD CELL BIOL, V63, P51; Kouri JB, 1998, MICROSC RES TECHNIQ, V40, P22, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19980101)40:1<22::AID-JEMT4>3.0.CO;2-Z; KUCIA M, 2006, J PHYSL PHARM, V57, P5; KUCIA M, 2007, DEV DYNAM, V236, P330; Petropavlovskaia M, 2002, CELL TISSUE RES, V310, P51, DOI 10.1007/s00441-002-0614-z; SHAPIRO HM, 2005, PRACTICAL FLOW CYTOM, P275; Tocchetti EV, 2001, THROMB RES, V103, P47, DOI 10.1016/S0049-3848(01)00263-8",39,59,66,2,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1582-1838,,,J CELL MOL MED,J.

To support model-based design, the Object Management Group has recently developed the Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML (TM)). The language is well-suited for modeling many different aspects of large-scale, multidisciplinary engineering projects. It allows systems designers to capture information concerning system requirements, tests, structures, functions, and behaviors. However, SysML lacks explicit support for modeling continuous system dynamics using DAE's. Such models are important for representing system behavior resulting from energy or signal exchange between system components. We introduce support for modeling system dynamics in the form of a language mapping between SysML and Modelica, an equation-based, object-oriented behavioral simulation language. The bidirectional mapping provides support for creating system dynamics models in SysML that can exist alongside other SysML information models, but that can also be transformed into executable simulations by a Modelica solver To illustrate the approach, we provide an example SysML model of a hydraulic pump.","[Johnson, Thomas A.; Jobe, Jonathan M.; Paredis, Christiaan J.

For embedded systems as well as for biological cell systems, design is a feature that defines their identity. The assembly of different components in designs of both systems can vary widely. In contrast to the biology domain, the computer engineering domain has the opportunity to quickly evaluate design options and consequences of its systems by methods for computer aided design and in particular design space exploration. We argue that there are enough concrete similarities between the two systems to assume that the engineering methodology from the computer systems domain, and in particular that related to embedded systems, can be applied to the domain of cellular systems. This will help to understand the myriad of different design options cellular systems have. First we compare computer systems with cellular systems. Then, we discuss exactly what features of engineering methods could aid researchers with the analysis of cellular systems, and what benefits could be gained. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of the study was to identify stumbling blocks to the adaptive management of fire and to test whether this could be done using participatory methods and a systems modelling tool called Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). Results from the case study indicate that the participatory system analysis approach provides a co-learning environment that captures the collective (corporate) knowledge of the factors influencing planning, implementing, monitoring and reviewing outcomes, thus allowing critical success factors (CSFs) influencing the success of adaptive management to be identified. BBN provided the scaffolding for piecing together this knowledge, allowing managers to structure complex problems and conduct dynamic sensitivity and scenario analysis to identify where intervention or investment can significantly improve the practice of adaptive management within a natural resource management (NRM) agency.

The S-system model is suitable to characterize biochemical network systems and capable of analyzing the regulatory system dynamics. However, the inference of an S-system model of N-gene genetic networks has 2N(N+1) parameters in a set of nonlinear differential equations to be optimized. This paper proposes an intelligent two-stage evolutionary algorithm (iTEA) to efficiently infer the S-system models of genetic networks from time-series data of gene expression. To cope with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed algorithm consists of two stages, where each uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. The optimization problem is first decomposed into N subproblems having 2(N+1) parameters each. At the first stage, each subproblem is solved using a novel intelligent genetic algorithm (IGA) with intelligent crossover based on an orthogonal experimental design (OED). At the second stage, the obtained N solutions to the N subproblems are combined and refined using an OED-based simulated annealing algorithm for handling noisy gene expression profiles. The effectiveness of iTEA is evaluated using simulated expression patterns with and without noise running on a single-processor PC. It is shown that 1) IGA is efficient enough to solve subproblems, 2) IGA is significantly superior to the existing method GA with simplex crossover (SPXGA), and 3) iTEA performs well in inferring S-system models for dynamic pathway identification.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Bioinformat, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; Jin Wen Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taipei 231, Taiwan","Ho, SY (reprint author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Bioinformat, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",syho@mail.nctu.edu.tw; hsiehch@gmail.com; hayyu.bi93g@nctu.edu.tw; hlhuang@jwit.edu.tw,,,,,"Akutsu T, 1999, PAC S BIOC, V4, P17; Lockhart DJ, 2000, NATURE, V405, P827, DOI 10.1038/35015701; Ho SY, 2004, IEEE T EVOLUT COMPUT, V8, P522, DOI 10.1109/TEVC.2004.835176; Yu J, 2004, BIOINFORMATICS, V20, P3594, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth448; Zou M, 2005, BIOINFORMATICS, V21, P71, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth463; Voit EO, 2004, BIOINFORMATICS, V20, P1670, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth140; Ho SJ, 2004, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V34, P588, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2004.832834; Brazhnik P, 2002, TRENDS BIOTECHNOL, V20, P467, DOI 10.1016/S0167-7799(02)02053-X; Tsai KY, 2005, BIOINFORMATICS, V21, P1180, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti099; Ho SJ, 2006, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V14, P421, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.876985; Moles CG, 2003, GENOME RES, V13, P2467, DOI 10.1101/gr.1262503; Friedman N, 2000, J COMPUT BIOL, V7, P601, DOI 10.1089/106652700750050961; Husmeier D, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P2271, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg313; Kimura S, 2005, BIOINFORMATICS, V21, P1154, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti071; SZU H, 1987, PHYS LETT A, V122, P157, DOI 10.1016/0375-9601(87)90796-1; Kikuchi S, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P643, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg027; Thieffry D, 1998, BIOESSAYS, V20, P433, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199805)20:5<433::AID-BIES10>3.0.CO;2-2; Akutsu T, 2000, J COMPUT BIOL, V7, P331, DOI 10.1089/106652700750050817; Bagchi T P, 1993, TAGUCHI METHODS EXPL; Hedayat A.

Sediment management in coastal zones is taking place in high complex environments. Present management options do not have a sophisticated way of dealing with the actual complexity of the physical and the social systems and with the unpredictability that is inherent with these systems. Therefore, a new approach in both policy making and sediment management is needed that takes this complexity into account. The aim of this article is to explore the dynamics in social and natural systems and to draw the contours of this new approach for policy processes and sediment management that fits to the dynamics of the systems. Methods. Three case studies concerning sediment management in Germany and the Netherlands are analysed in this article, in which unpredictability, or whimsicality, appeared through the occurrence of unexpected events. The case studies are analysed from the perspective of complexity theory. Complexity theory is a systemic theory, which means that it explains empirical phenomena from complex system behaviour. To understand the capricious character of sediment management in coastal zones, we need to frame the issue as the interdependency between the physical system and the social system, causing the two systems to develop in mutual adjustment through feedback. The process of mutual adjustment is one that is characterised by a non-linear nature. This is caused by the multiple relationships and the feedback within and between the systems, and the occurrence of chance events. Chance events (surprises) happen suddenly without an apparent cause and are important triggers for change in the systems. In three empirical cases, the occurrence, nature and response to these chance events are analysed as these factors influence the course of sediment management. Results and Discussion. The case studies show that chance events can occur in the biophysical and in the social system. In the three cases, players or actors in the decision process are left with the choice to adapt themselves to the occurring chance events or to refrain from any adaptive behaviour. Chance events can open up new possibilities by activating (new) actors and by coupling to new issues. If the situation is too locked-in (i.e. a stalemate) and is intentional on behalf of the actors, than the chance event will have no effect. There are, however, situations of lock-in that are unintentional, and in such situations a chance event can remove this lock-in. The effects depend largely on the adaptive capacity of the actors to respond adequately and timely to such situations. The adaptive capacity can be increased (and uncertainty reduced) by a better understanding of both the physical and the social system. The case studies show that adaptation is an adequate way of dealing with the occurrence of chance events. Conclusions. We conclude that the way to deal with non-linear developments is through an adaptive policy approach with short feedback loops in order to allow for timely adjustments and learning loops that will progress the understanding of the systems - both social and physical. Besides the instruments that are already available, like modelling and forecasting, instruments like observation and monitoring, stakeholder involvement processes, and learning and adaptation should be developed in this new adaptive approach. Monitoring of the physical system is a key element in this approach as all involved parties and stake-holders can learn how the physical system behaves. In this adaptive approach, whimsicality - that occurs through unexpected events - is an interesting challenge for all concerned with sediment management. Recommendations and Perspectives. The proposed adaptive policy approach should be developed further and should be experimented with in real life situations that are well monitored.","TNO Geosci & Environm, Dept Innovat & Environm, Delft, Netherlands; Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Slob, A (reprint author), TNO Geosci & Environm, Dept Innovat & Environm, POB 49, Delft, Netherlands.",Adriaan.slob@tno.nl,"Gerrits, Lasse/N-1205-2013",,,,"Hughes TP, 2005, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V20, P380, DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2005.03.022; Scheffer M, 2001, NATURE, V413, P591, DOI 10.1038/35098000; Gurnell AM, 2007, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V89, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.07.012; Malanson GP, 2006, ENVIRON PLANN A, V38, P619, DOI 10.1068/a37340; Pierson P, 2000, AM POLIT SCI REV, V94, P251, DOI 10.2307/2586011; O'Sullivan D, 2006, ENVIRON PLANN A, V38, P611, DOI 10.1068/a3812; Blott SJ, 2006, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V81, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.04.008; Kotchen MJ, 2007, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V17, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2007.01.001; Henrickson L, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P7288, DOI 10.1073/pnas.092079799; Macleod CJA, 2007, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V373, P591, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.12.029; Apitz Sabine, 2003, Journal of Soils and Sediments, V3, P132, DOI 10.1065/jss2003.08.083; Apitz SE, 2005, J SOILS SEDIMENTS, V5, P129, DOI 10.1065/jss2005.08.001; Arthur W.B., 1994, INCREASING RETURNS P; BERGH JCJ, 2005, SUVIVAL GREENEST; BOER DHD, 2001, COMPUTER GEOSCIENCES, V27, P995; BRUIJN KMD, 2004, WATER POLICY, V6, P53; BUUREN AV, 2007, ENCY GOVERNANCE; DAVID PA, 1985, AM ECON REV, V75, P332; FOSTER J, 2004, APPL EVOLUTIONARY EV; GERRITS L, 2008, IN PRESS GENTLE ART; GERRITS L, 2008, UNPUB LAND USE POLIC; Goldsmith S., 2004, GOVERNING BY NETWORK; HISSCHEMOLLER M, 2001, INTEGRATED ASSESSMEN, V2, P27; John Holland, 1995, HIDDEN ORDER ADAPTAT; Kauffman S.A., 1993, ORIGINS ORDER; Lankford B, 2007, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V17, P168, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.05.003; Marion R, 1999, EDGE ORG; MULDER P, 1999, EVOLUTIONARY EC THEO; NGUYEN T, 2004, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V22, P1557; Norgaard RB, 1995, REV SOC ECON, V53, P475; Norgaard R.

They have reached the test and demonstration phase in automotive and power markets today. This paper is focused on a stand-alone residential PEMFC power system that provides the electricity needs of the house. A novel stochastic sizing methodology is developed that considers both fuel cell system dynamics and residential load dynamics in overall system sizing for the stand-alone residential fuel cell power system. Understanding the nature of demand side is critical in stand-alone system sizing. Thus, experimental measurements have been completed to capture the load side dynamics in detail. No such data is found in the current literature. The Threshold Bootstrap method is used to model the residential load demand and to produce many realistic load profiles. Matlab/Simulink is used to run system simulations to determine system sizes based on parameters defined through a designed experiment. Comparison between the proposed sizing method and a possible worst case scenario sizing is given.

Such systems are assumed to be a response to the costs of grouping, but evidence to support this hypothesis is limited. We use a linear programming approach to build a time budget model that predicts the upper bound on group size in order to test the hypothesis that fission-fusion social systems are the outcome of time constraints. Comparative data from 14 wild chimpanzee (Pan spp.) populations are used to derive a set of equations defining the relationship between climatic variables and time budget components, which are then used to calculate the upper limits on group size that can be maintained in different habitats. We validate the model by showing that it correctly predicts the presence/absence of chimpanzees across sub-Saharan Africa and the group sizes observed in natural populations. The model suggests that the costs of travel are limiting for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can reduce these costs dramatically by fissioning their bonded communities into small foraging parties. If they did not, they would be unable to live in any habitats where they currently occur.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, British Acad, Centenary Res Project, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England","Lehmann, J (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, British Acad, Centenary Res Project, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England.",j.lehmann@liv.ac.uk,"Korstjens, Amanda/E-6051-2010; ","Korstjens, Amanda/0000-0002-9587-4020",,,"Alexander R.D., 1974, Annual Rev Ecol Syst, V5, P325, DOI 10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545; Altmann J., 1980, BABOON MOTHERS INFAN; Anderson DP, 2002, BEHAVIOURAL DIVERSITY IN CHIMPANZEES AND BONOBOS, P90, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511606397.010; Yamakoshi G, 1998, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V106, P283, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199807)106:3<283::AID-AJPA2>3.0.CO;2-O; Lehmann J, 2004, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V56, P207, DOI 10.1007/s00265-004-0781-x; DUNBAR RIM, 1988, ANIM BEHAV, V36, P970, DOI 10.1016/S0003-3472(88)80055-1; MCGREW WC, 1988, AM J PRIMATOL, V16, P213, DOI 10.1002/ajp.1350160304; McBrearty S, 2005, NATURE, V437, P105, DOI 10.1038/nature04008; SUGIYAMA Y, 1987, PRIMATES, V28, P133, DOI 10.1007/BF02382192; LEGATES DR, 1990, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V41, P11, DOI 10.1007/BF00866198; VANSCHAIK CP, 1983, BEHAVIOUR, V85, P91, DOI 10.1163/156853983X00057; DUNBAR RIM, 1992, PRIMATES, V33, P69, DOI 10.1007/BF02382763; Tutin CEG, 1997, AM J PRIMATOL, V42, P1, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1997)42:1<1::AID-AJP1>3.0.CO;2-0; Takemoto H, 2004, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V124, P81, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.10342; Watts DP, 2000, INT J PRIMATOL, V21, P189, DOI 10.1023/A:1005469302911; OWENS MJ, 1978, E AFR WILDL J, V16, P113; Newton-Fisher NE, 1999, BEHAVIOUR, V136, P705, DOI 10.1163/156853999501531; SMOLKER RA, 1992, BEHAVIOUR, V123, P38, DOI 10.1163/156853992X00101; Hashimoto C, 2001, INT J PRIMATOL, V22, P947, DOI 10.1023/A:1012061504420; Newton-Fisher NE, 1999, AFR J ECOL, V37, P344, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2028.1999.00186.x; Nishida T, 2003, AM J PRIMATOL, V59, P99, DOI 10.1002/ajp.10068; CARACO T, 1979, ECOLOGY, V60, P611, DOI 10.2307/1936081; Williams JM, 2004, ANIM BEHAV, V68, P523, DOI 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.09.015; CHAPMAN CA, 1995, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V36, P59, DOI 10.1007/BF00175729; TUTIN CEG, 1993, AM J PRIMATOL, V30, P195, DOI 10.1002/ajp.1350300305; Hashimoto C, 2003, PRIMATES, V44, P77, DOI 10.1007/s10329-002-0026-4; DUNBAR RIM, 1984, Z TIERPSYCHOL, V64, P163; Tweheyo M, 2004, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V188, P267, DOI 10.1016/j.foreco.2003.07.028; Matsumoto-Oda A, 1998, INT J PRIMATOL, V19, P999, DOI 10.1023/A:1020322203166; Hill RA, 2002, EVOL ECOL, V16, P579, DOI 10.1023/A:1021625003597; Newton-Fisher NE, 2000, INT J PRIMATOL, V21, P613, DOI 10.1023/A:1005561203763; Boesch C, 2000, CHIMPANZEES TAI FORE; Boesch Christophe, 1996, P101, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511752414.010; BOESCH C, 1991, BEHAVIOUR, V117, P221; Butynski Thomas M., 2001, P3; CALDCOTT J, 2005, WORLD ATLAS GREAT AP; Chapman CA, 1994, CHIMPANZEE CULTURES; De Fries R, 2000, CONTINUOUS FIELDS 1; Doran D, 1997, INT J PRIMATOL, V18, P183, DOI 10.1023/A:1026368518431; DUNBAR RIM, 1991, FOLIA PRIMATOL, V57, P121, DOI 10.1159/000156574; DUNBAR RIM, 1992, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V31, P35, DOI 10.1007/BF00167814; DUNBAR RIM, 1992, J HUM EVOL, V22, P407, DOI 10.1016/0047-2484(92)90068-K; Dunbar R.I.M., 1996, Proceedings of the British Academy, V88, P33; EGGERT MKH, 1992, WORLD ARCHAEOL, V24, P1; Eriksson J, 2004, MOL ECOL, V13, P3425, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02332.x; FAWCETT KA, 2000, THESIS U EDINBERGH; Ghiglieri M.P., 1984, P161; Goodall J, 1968, ANIM BEHAV MONOGR, V1, P161; Goodall J, 1986, CHIMPANZEES GOMBE PA; GOODALL J, 1983, Z TIERPSYCHOL, V61, P1; GREENGRASS E, 1986, PAN AFR NEWS, V7; HUNT KD, 2002, HEHAV DIVERSITY CHIM, P35; Itani J., 1967, Primates, V8, P355, DOI 10.1007/BF01792020; JONES C, 1971, COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY; Kano T., 1984, P233; Klein L.

In this paper, the system design of an LSI scanner is analyzed and a beam hardening (BH) correction method is presented. In our method, a Full-liquid linearization is used and the lookup table (LUT) technique is introduced to quickly implement this procedure. Lack of prior knowledge, we present a blind BH correction approach. We store some representative liquid models in advance. Raw polychromatic projection is first corrected (using the Full-liquid correction) by a default model (water). Basing on the reconstruction results, a new model will be carefully selected to do this again, unless the scanned liquid matches our correction model. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here we study how middle school students and teachers think about everyday settings involving feedback, stocks and flows, time delays and nonlinearities, prior to any formal training in these concepts. We develop instruments to elicit understanding of systems concepts and test them with students and teachers from two middle schools in the U.S.A. We find, with some exceptions, generally limited intuitive systems thinking abilities. ""Open-loop"" or one-way causal thinking is common. Explanations lack references to time horizons and time delays. Significant misconceptions of stock and flow structures appear regardless of age. Teachers generally outperformed students, although one-quarter of the students performed at the median level for teachers. We discuss the nature of students' and teachers' intuitive models of dynamic systems, explore potential barriers to understanding dynamic systems, and discuss implications for effective teaching of systems concepts.

Farm system models provide means to formalize, expand and refine expert knowledge and to integrate this with scientific agro-ecological knowledge at the farm level. The prototyping methodology was developed for the design of more sustainable farm systems, either on experimental or commercial farms. The main features of prototyping are: (1) quantification of goals; (2) emphasis on multiple societal goals; (3) designing as an organizing principle; (4) iteration of system analysis, design and on-farm testing. Hypothetically, farm system modelling could enrich the prototyping methodology and vice versa. Taking a goal-oriented stance, a modelling exercise could reveal design options otherwise overlooked and extrapolation of prototyping results to other conditions and scenarios. The on-farm prototyping work could serve as a source of inspiration and information for farm system modelers. However, little cross-pollination between the modelling and prototyping efforts has occurred, even though the methodologies have been applied in parallel and in one country. Existing reports on prototyping projects merely present their methodological set-up and results, but lack description of the implementation of the methodology. We deemed insight into the implementation of prototyping essential to understand the discrepancy between theory and practice and to investigate the potential for cross-pollination between modelling and prototyping in the future. Three promising leads were identified to assess this potential, i.e. (1) exploring goals of farm systems; (2) exploring options for a change and improvement of farm systems; (3) communication and extrapolation of project output. Analysis of more than two decades of Dutch prototyping research both on experimental and commercial farms indicated that prototyping on commercial farms is a highly localized process. Moreover, although the methodology manual suggests differently, goal formulation was not a distinctive phase of prototyping on commercial farms, so cross-pollination with farm system modelling could not occur (lead 1). As the timely operational ization and the localization of a farm system model demand considerable effort, contributions of farm model explorations to the localized change process on commercial farms (lead 2) seem impractical and unlikely. For communication and extrapolation of prototyping output (lead 3), issue-specific (i.e. focus on a component of the system) models are increasingly used. For this purpose, we hypothesize that there may also be a role for farm system models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Working with a mentor and with clinic and medical group leaders, he established a clear goal, focused on a repeatable and important performance measure, and used repeated rapid cycle trials to make systems changes in care, with extensive task delegation to team members and emphasis on repeated testing and treatment intensification. The composite outcome measure requires that each diabetes patient meet all 5 of the following: LDL < 100, HbA(1c) < 7, systolic blood pressure < 130, regular aspirin use, and tobacco-free status. Results: Over a 24-month period, quarterly measures for this physician's patients rose from 5.7% to 42.9%, while the 7000 diabetes patients of the entire medical group only increased from 4.2% to 12.1%. The change for those patients who stayed under his care for the entire period was even more dramatic - from 2.3% to 46.5% ( P = <. 0001). The largest improvements were for smoking documentation, aspirin use, and LDL control, with little change in HbA(1c) levels. Conclusion: One physician can accomplish a lot, if improvement is approached both systematically and persistently and if the work is coordinated with and supported by practice leaders.","Hlth Partners Res Fdn, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA; Hlth Partners Med Grp, Minneapolis, MN USA","Solberg, LI (reprint author), Hlth Partners Res Fdn, POB 1524,Mailstop 21111R, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA.",Leif.I.Solberg@HealthPartners.com,,,,,"Amundson Gail M, 2003, Minn Med, V86, P50; Egede LE, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P427, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.4.427; Berwick DM, 2003, MED CARE, V41, pI30; Fox CS, 2004, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V292, P2495, DOI 10.1001/jama.292.20.2495; Steiner JF, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V294, P2901, DOI 10.1001/jama.294.22.2901; Keating NL, 2004, MED CARE, V42, P829, DOI 10.1097/01.mlr.0000135829.73795.a7; Berwick DM, 1998, ANN INTERN MED, V128, P651; Berwick DM, 2003, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V289, P1969, DOI 10.1001/jama.289.15.1969; Fireman B, 2004, HEALTH AFFAIR, V23, P63, DOI 10.1377/hlthhaff.23.6.63; Berlowitz DR, 2005, HEALTH SERV RES, V40, P1836, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00436.x; Larme AC, 2001, DIABETES CARE, V24, P1728, DOI 10.2337/diacare.24.10.1728; O'Connor PJ, 2003, ARCH INTERN MED, V163, P2677, DOI 10.1001/archinte.163.22.2677; Ofman JJ, 2004, AM J MED, V117, P182, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.03.018; Glasgow RE, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P33, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.1.33; LANGLEY GJ, 1994, QUAL PROG, V27, P81; Saaddine JB, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P465; O'Connor PJ, 2005, ANN FAM MED, V3, P300, DOI 10.1370/afm.327; Brun E, 2000, DIABETES CARE, V23, P1119, DOI 10.2337/diacare.23.8.1119; Bodenheimer T, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P1775, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.14.1775; Nolan T, 2006, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V295, P1168, DOI 10.1001/jama.295.10.1168; Kiefe CI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2871, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.22.2871; Imperatore G, 2004, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V160, P531, DOI 10.1093/aje/kwh232; Gilmer TP, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P59, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.1.59; Bodenheimer T, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P1909, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.15.1909; Bodenheimer Thomas, 2004, Jt Comm J Qual Saf, V30, P505; Helseth LD, 1999, J FAM PRACTICE, V48, P37; Hiss RG, 1996, ANN INTERN MED, V124, P146; Langley G, 1996, IMPROVEMENT GUIDE PR; O'Connor P J, 1998, J Fam Pract, V47, pS13; O'Connor PJ, 2001, DIS MANAG HEALTH OUT, V9, P691, DOI 10.2165/00115677-200109120-00003; O'Connor PJ, 2005, HEALTH SERV RES, V40, P1854, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00437.x; OCONNOR PJ, 2005, ADV PATIENT SAFETY R, P293; O'Connor Patrick J, 2002, J Am Board Fam Pract, V15, P334; O'Connor PJ, 2003, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V15, P283, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzg062; Perlin JB, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P525; Savage PJ, 1999, DIABETES CARE, V22, P1769, DOI 10.2337/diacare.22.11.1769; Solberg LI, 1997, ANN BEHAV MED, V19, P271, DOI 10.1007/BF02892291; Sperl-Hillen J, 2000, Jt Comm J Qual Improv, V26, P615; Sperl-Hillen JM, 2005, AM J MANAG CARE, V11, pS177; Streja DA, 1999, ARCH INTERN MED, V159, P294, DOI 10.1001/archinte.159.3.294",40,7,9,4,11,AMER BOARD FAMILY MEDICINE,LEXINGTON,"2228 YOUNG DR, LEXINGTON, KY 40505 USA",1557-2625,,,J AM BOARD FAM MED,J.

Population coverage levels at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% for HAART, and 5% and 80% of MDRTB treatment cure rates were simulated over a 10-year period and cumulative deaths from tuberculosis and HIV-associated tuberculosis were estimated for populations with latent tuberculosis, DSTB, MDRTB, HIV and HIV-associated tuberculosis. Depending on levels of HAART population coverage, increasing MDRTB cure rates from 5% to 80% reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 1% and 13%. High population coverage with HAART (75% or higher), allied with high MDRTB cure rates, reduces cumulative deaths by 60%, with limited impact below this level. High coverage with HAART is required to substantially reduce the number of deaths from tuberculosis.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Hlth Management, Tanaka Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; Barts & London Sch Med, Inst Cell Mol Sci, London, England; London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, London, England","Atun, RA (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Hlth Management, Tanaka Business Sch, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",r.atun@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,"Vynnycky E, 1999, INT J EPIDEMIOL, V28, P327, DOI 10.1093/ije/28.2.327; De Cock KM, 1999, INT J TUBERC LUNG D, V3, P457; Williams BG, 2003, SCIENCE, V301, P1535, DOI 10.1126/science.1086845; Vynnycky E, 2000, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V152, P247, DOI 10.1093/aje/152.3.247; HOMER JB, 1991, INTERFACES, V21, P26, DOI 10.1287/inte.21.3.26; Dye C, 2000, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V97, P8180, DOI 10.1073/pnas.140102797; Tahaoglu K, 2001, NEW ENGL J MED, V345, P170, DOI 10.1056/NEJM200107193450303; Murray CJL, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P13881, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.23.13881; Coker RJ, 2004, TROP MED INT HEALTH, V9, P25, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-3156.2003.01156.x; Homer J, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P199, DOI 10.1002/sdr.295; Coetzee D, 2004, TROP MED INT HEALTH, V9, pA11, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01259.x; Rhodes T, 2002, AIDS, V16, pF25, DOI 10.1097/00002030-200209060-00002; Blower SM, 1996, SCIENCE, V273, P497, DOI 10.1126/science.273.5274.497; Currie CSM, 2003, AIDS, V17, P2501, DOI 10.1097/00002030-200311210-00013; Mitnick C, 2003, NEW ENGL J MED, V348, P119, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa022928; Atun RA, 2005, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V83, P730; Atun RA, 2005, INT J STD AIDS, V16, P560, DOI 10.1258/0956462054679124; ATUN RA, 2004, P 22 INT C SYSTEM DY; Blower SM, 1998, J MOL MED-JMM, V76, P624, DOI 10.1007/s001090050260; Centers for Disease C Prevention, 1999, MMWR-MORBID MORTAL W, V48, P661; Dangerfield BC, 2001, SYST DYNAM REV, V17, P119, DOI 10.1002/sdr.211; DEANGELIS D, 1998, APPL STAT, V47, P447; Dolan K, 1998, DRUG ALCOHOL DEPEN, V50, P197, DOI 10.1016/S0376-8716(98)00009-X; Forrester J.

Risks can cause delays to the planned schedule of a project, add a significant cost, and Greatly influence its profitability. Uncertainties can be associated with project risks, as well as with opportunities that can develop throughout the project's lifecycle. Having the ability to plan for these uncertainties, by incorporating flexible alternatives into the system design. is increasingly recognized as critical to long-term corporate success. This paper advances the knowledge needed to incorporate flexibility in systems engineering and management for both practitioners and researchers. Flexibility is defined in this paper as the ability of a system to sustain performance, preserve a particular cost structure, adapt to internal or external changes in operating conditions, or take advantage of new opportunities that develop during a mine's life cycle by modifying operational parameters. By engaging in planning for flexible production systems, the effects of risk on a particular project value can be examined, project volatility can be calculated, and potential flexible mining alternatives can be evaluated. Once identified, a real options valuation provides a strategic decision-making tool for mine planners to determine the value of incorporating flexible alternatives into the mine plan. This paper demonstrates that flexibility can become an equal partner among the parameters controlling the decision-making process for underground engineering construction systems. followed by industry practitioners. It presents a methodology in mine production system design by introducing flexibility into design through the application of real options valuation techniques. Real world case studies related to flexible planning and design of construction and production systems in underground hard rock mines are presented.","Laurentian Univ, Sch Engn, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","Mayer, Z (reprint author), Laurentian Univ, Sch Engn, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",vkazakidis@laurentian.ca,,,,,"De Toni A, 1998, INT J PROD RES, V36, P1587, DOI 10.1080/002075498193183; de Neufville R, 2006, J INFRASTRUCT SYST, V12, P107, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2006)12:2(107); Luehrman TA, 1998, HARVARD BUS REV, V76, P51; Bjerksund P., 1993, SCANDINAVIAN J MANAG, V9, P87; BLACK F, 1973, J POLITICAL EC, V81, P631; BREYFOGLE III F.

Meanwhile, to meet the requirements of higher spindle speeds and more versatile machining capabilities, it is becoming necessary for engineers to thoroughly realize how the spindle system design would influence the system dynamics with considering highspeed effects. With this understanding, machine tool designers can enhance the performances of automatic high-speed machine tools such as spindle speeds, metal removal rates, and machining quality. In this paper, I first develop a design flow chart to represent the overall spindle design problems. Based on this flow chart, eight design parameters are identified. A design sensitivity analysis of these eight design parameters is then conducted based on an integrated finite element method model to investigate their influence on the natural frequencies of the spindle system. The results show that the most important design parameters to the system dynamics include spacing between the front and rear bearing sets, spacing between middle line of the two bearing set and the free end of cutter, and length of the spindle shaft.","Minghsin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Lin, CW (reprint author), Minghsin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",,,,,,"ALSHAREEF KJH, 1990, P I MECH ENG B-J ENG, V204, P91; Altinta Y., 1995, CIRP ANN-MANUF TECHN, V44, P357, DOI [10.1016/S0007-8506(07)62342-7, DOI 10.1016/S0007-8506(07)62342-7]; TLUSTY J, 1986, J ENG IND-T ASME, V108, P59; Lin CW, 2003, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V43, P1035, DOI 10.1016/S0890-6955(03)00091-9; ALSHAREEF KJH, 1990, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V30, P431, DOI 10.1016/0890-6955(90)90187-N; Bossmanns B, 1999, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V39, P1345, DOI 10.1016/S0890-6955(99)00005-X; Maeda O, 2005, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V45, P537, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2004.08.021; Bossmanns B, 2001, J MANUF SCI E-T ASME, V123, P494, DOI 10.1115/1.1349555; Kang Y, 2001, FINITE ELEM ANAL DES, V37, P485, DOI 10.1016/S0168-874X(00)00049-4; Koenigsberger F, 1970, MACHINE TOOL STRUCTU, V1; Li HQ, 2004, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V44, P347, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2003.10.011; Stein J.L., 1994, T ASME, V116, P372; TU J, 2004, J AEROSPACE ENG, V1, P1; TU J, 1995, TRIBOL T, V38, P201; WARDLE F, 1983, PRECIS ENG, V5, P174",15,0,1,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-0827-6,,,,2007,,,,,,,2087,2092,,10.1109/ICMA.2007.4303873,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,BGX87,WOS:000251178102087,B,"Eriksson, M",,,IEEE,"Eriksson, Margaretha",,,How Systems Thinking Methods Increase Usability of User Manuals - a Case Study,2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE,,,English,Proceedings Paper,IEEE International Engineering Management Conference,"JUL 29-AUG 01, 2007","Lost Pines, TX",IEEE,,"Systems thinking; system design; user documentation; manuals; usability; ""5 Why""; ""What is the problem?""

The applied methods were the ""5 Why"", ""What is the problem?"" ""Storytelling"", and ""Links and Loops"". This investigation shows that the poor usability of system user manuals is a management issue. With a system design centric view of the System-of-Interest (Sol) there is little feedback on the content and efficiency of the manuals from the system users to the technical writers. When Designers update or correct the program code due to a trouble report, they forget to inform the technical writers. The descriptions of system features and functions are made with an internal view of the system, since Designers have written the descriptions. A system administrator is using the GUI of the system and need a process-oriented system manual written from an external system view in order be successful. The lack of both macro-structure and micro-structure in the system manuals lead to the situation that it is easier to create a new system document than updating or adding information to a number of existing documents.","Irbis Konsult AB, Stockholm, Sweden","Eriksson, M (reprint author), Irbis Konsult AB, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,"Cooper A, 2004, INMATES RUNNING ASYL; ERIKSSON M, 2006, IEEE INT ENG MAN C S; ERIKSSON M, 2005, IEEE INT PROF COMM C; LAWSON H, 2004, JOURNEY SYSTEM UNPUB; SENGE PM, 2000, 5 DISCIPLINE FIELDBO",5,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-2145-9,,,,2007,,,,,,,215,220,,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Engineering,BOZ34,WOS:000278100300035,B,"Wenig, P; Schoorf, M; Gunther, O; Yang, B; Weigel, R",,,IEEE,"Wenig, Peter; Schoorf, Michael; Guenther, Oliver; Yang, Bin; Weigel, Robert",,,System design of a 77 GHz automotive radar sensor with superresolution DOA estimation,"2007 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1 AND 2",,,English,Proceedings Paper,"International Symposium on Signals, Systems and Electronics","JUL 30-AUG 02, 2007","Montreal, CANADA",IEEE,,automotive radar; direction of arrival estimation; system analysis and design; array signal processing; antenna arrays,,This paper introduces a novel 77 GHz FMCW automotive long range radar (LRR) system concept.

Major new standards for representation of pathway data and the ability to check inconsistency in pathways are inevitable for the development of a reliable pathway data repository. Within the context of biological pathways, the cell system ontology (CSO) had been developed as a general framework to model system dynamics and visualization of diverse biological pathways. CSO provides an excellent environment for modeling, visualizing, and simulating complex molecular mechanisms at different levels of details. This paper examines whether CSO addresses the integration capability of pathway data with system dynamics. We present a conversion tool for converting BioPAX to CSO. Transforming the data from BioPAX to CSO not only allows an analysis of the dynamic behaviors in molecular interactions but also allows the results to be stored for further biological investigations, which is not possible in BioPAX. The conversion is done using simple inference algorithms with the addition of view- and simulation-related properties. We demonstrate how CSO can be used to build a complete and consistent pathway repository and enhance the inter-operability among applications.","[Jeong, Euna; Nagasaki, Masao; Miyano, Satoru] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Ctr Human Genome, Tokyo 1088639, Japan","Jeong, E (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Ctr Human Genome, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",,,,,,"Bader G.D., 2005, BIOPAX BIOL PATHWAYS; FINNEY A, 2003, SYSTEMS BIOL MARKUP; JEONG E, 2007, SILICO BIOL; Kojima K, 2007, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V8, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-8-76; Nagasaki Masao, 2004, Genome Inform, V15, P180; Smith M.

This insight, which disciplines like physics have embraced for a long time already, is gradually gaining importance in the study of cognitive processes by functional neuroimaging. In this field, causal mechanisms in neural systems are described in terms of effective connectivity. Recently, dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced as a generic method to estimate effective connectivity from neuroirnaging data in a Bayesian fashion. One of the key advantages of DCM over previous methods is that it distinguishes between neural state equations and modality-specific forward models that translate neural activity into a measured signal. Another strength is its natural relation to Bayesian model selection (BMS) procedures. In this article, we review the conceptual and mathematical basis of DCM and its implementation for functional magnetic resonance imaging data and event-related potentials. After introducing the application of BMS in the context of DCM, we conclude with an outlook to future extensions of DCM. These extensions are guided by the long-term goal of using dynamic system models for pharmacological and clinical applications, particularly with regard to synaptic plasticity.","UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England; Univ Grenoble 1, CHU, INSERM, U594, F-38043 Grenoble 09, France","Stephan, KE (reprint author), UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, 12 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",k.stephan@fil.ion.ucl-ac.uk,"Friston, Karl/D-9230-2011; Kiebel, Stefan/B-1551-2009; David, Olivier/A-6068-2009; ","Friston, Karl/0000-0001-7984-8909; David, Olivier/0000-0003-0776-0216; Stephan, Klaas Enno/0000-0002-8594-9092; Penny, William/0000-0001-9064-1191",,,"AERTSEN A, 1991, NONLIN SYST, V2, P281; Bitan T, 2005, J NEUROSCI, V25, P5397, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0864-05.2005; Friston KJ, 2002, NEUROIMAGE, V16, P513, DOI 10.1006/nimg.2001.1044; Harrison LM, 2005, PHILOS T R SOC B, V360, P1075, DOI 10.1098/rstb.2005.1648; Buchel C, 1997, CEREB CORTEX, V7, P768, DOI 10.1093/cercor/7.8.768; Honey GD, 2003, BRAIN, V126, P1767, DOI 10.1093/brain/awg184; Gottesman II, 2003, AM J PSYCHIAT, V160, P636, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.636; Friston KJ, 1998, SCHIZOPHR RES, V30, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0920-9964(97)00140-0; Smith APR, 2006, NEURON, V49, P631, DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.12.025; DEMPSTER AP, 1977, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V39, P1; Schultz W, 2000, ANNU REV NEUROSCI, V23, P473, DOI 10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.473; Stephan KE, 2005, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V1064, P16, DOI 10.1196/annals.1340.008; Friston KJ, 2002, ANNU REV NEUROSCI, V25, P221, DOI 10.1146/annurev.neuro.25.112701.142846; Stephan KE, 2004, J ANAT, V205, P443, DOI 10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00359.x; Friston KJ, 2000, NEUROIMAGE, V12, P466, DOI 10.1006/nimg.2000.0630; Jirsa VK, 2004, NEUROINFORMATICS, V2, P183, DOI 10.1385/NI:2:2:183; Raftery AE, 1995, SOCIOL METHODOL, V25, P111, DOI 10.2307/271063; David O, 2006, NEUROIMAGE, V30, P1255, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.10.045; David O, 2003, NEUROIMAGE, V20, P1743, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.07.015; Pitt MA, 2002, TRENDS COGN SCI, V6, P421, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01964-2; Goebel R, 2003, MAGN RESON IMAGING, V21, P1251, DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2003.08.026; Harrison L, 2003, NEUROIMAGE, V19, P1477, DOI 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00160-5; Penny WD, 2004, NEUROIMAGE, V23, pS264, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.041; JANSEN BH, 1995, BIOL CYBERN, V73, P357, DOI 10.1007/BF00199471; Friston KJ, 2003, NEUROIMAGE, V19, P1273, DOI 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00202-7; Breakspear M, 2003, NETWORK-COMP NEURAL, V14, P703, DOI 10.1088/0954-898X/14/4/305; Mechelli A, 2003, J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI, V15, P925, DOI 10.1162/089892903770007317; Kiebel SJ, 2006, NEUROIMAGE, V30, P1273, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.12.055; Penny WD, 2004, NEUROIMAGE, V22, P1157, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.026; Buxton RB, 1998, MAGNET RESON MED, V39, P855, DOI 10.1002/mrm.1910390602; Honey G, 2004, TRENDS PHARMACOL SCI, V25, P366, DOI 10.1016/j.tips.2004.05.009; Stephan KE, 2006, BIOL PSYCHIAT, V59, P929, DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.10.005; David O, 2005, NEUROIMAGE, V25, P756, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.030; Friston Karl J., 1994, Human Brain Mapping, V2, P56, DOI 10.1002/hbm.460020107; McIntosh A.

Combining the ultimate in systems phenotyping with in-depth investigations of biomolecular mechanisms will enable a revolution in our understanding of disease pathology and will advance translational medicine, combination therapies, integrative medicine, and personalized medicine. A prerequisite for deriving the benefits of such a systems approach is a reliable and well-validated bioanalytical platform across complementary measurement modalities, especially transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, that operates in concert with a megavariate integrative biostatistical/bioinformatics platform. The applicable bioanalytical methodologies must undergo an intense development trajectory to reach an optimal level of reliable performance and quantitative reproducibility in daily practice. Moreover, to generate such enabling systems information, it is essential to design experiments based on an understanding of the complexity and statistical characteristics of the large data sets created. Novel insights into biology and system science can be obtained by evaluating the molecular connectivity within a system through correlation networks, by monitoring the dynamics of a system, or by measuring the system responses to perturbations such as drug administration or challenge tests. In addition, cross-compartment communication and control/feed-back mechanisms can be studied via correlation network analyses. All these data analyses depend critically upon the generation of high-quality bioanalytical platform data sets. The emphasis of this paper is on the characteristics of a bioanalytical platform that we have developed to generate such data sets. The broad applicability of Systems Biology in pharmaceutical research and development is discussed with examples in disease biomarker research, in pharmacology using system response monitoring, and in cross-compartment system toxicology assessment.","BG Med Inc, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, TNO, Zeist, Netherlands; LACDR, Ctr Med Syst Biol, Gorlaeus Labs, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","van der Greef, J (reprint author), BG Med Inc, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",jan.vandergreef@tno.nl,,,,,"AHN CA, 2006, PLOS MED, V3, pE208; AHN CA, 2006, PLOS MED, V3, DOI UNSP 0709-0713; Koek MM, 2006, ANAL CHEM, V78, P1272, DOI 10.1021/ac051683+; Bijlsma S, 2006, ANAL CHEM, V78, P567, DOI 10.1021/ac051495j; Frantz S, 2005, NATURE, V437, P942, DOI 10.1038/437942a; Khanin R, 2006, J COMPUT BIOL, V13, P810, DOI 10.1089/cmb.2006.13.810; Oltvai ZN, 2002, SCIENCE, V298, P763, DOI 10.1126/science.1078563; Coulier L, 2006, ANAL CHEM, V78, P6573, DOI 10.1021/ac0607616; Nicholson JK, 2004, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V22, P1268, DOI 10.1038/nbt1015; Tusher VG, 2001, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V98, P5116, DOI 10.1073/pnas.091062498; Fliri AF, 2005, NAT CHEM BIOL, V1, P389, DOI 10.1038/nchembio747; Benichou O, 2006, PHYS REV E, V74, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.74.020102; Ambroise C, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P6562, DOI 10.1073/pnas.102102699; van der Greef J, 2005, J CHEMOMETR, V19, P376, DOI 10.1002/cem.941; van der Greef J, 2004, CURR OPIN CHEM BIOL, V8, P559, DOI 10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.08.013; Fishman MC, 2005, NATURE, V437, P491, DOI 10.1038/437491a; Fliri AF, 2005, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V102, P261, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0407790101; Lindon JC, 2005, PHARMACOGENOMICS, V6, P691, DOI 10.2217/14622416.6.7.691; Keith CT, 2005, NAT REV DRUG DISCOV, V4, P71, DOI 10.1038/nrd1609; Antti H, 2002, J CHEMOMETR, V16, P461, DOI 10.1002/cem.733; Steuer R, 2003, BIOCHEM SOC T, V31, P1476; Shlesinger MF, 2006, NATURE, V443, P281, DOI 10.1038/443281a; BENJAMINI Y, 1995, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V57, P289; Steuer R, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P1019, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg120; Ideker T, 2001, ANNU REV GENOM HUM G, V2, P343, DOI 10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.343; Vazquez A, 2004, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V101, P17940, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0406024101; Hood L, 2004, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V22, P1215, DOI 10.1038/nbt1004-1215; Borisy AA, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P7977, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1337088100; van der Greef J, 2005, NAT REV DRUG DISCOV, V4, P961, DOI 10.1038/nrd1904; Van der Greef J, 2006, PHARMACOGENOMICS, V7, P1087, DOI 10.2217/14622416.7.7.1087; Antti H, 2004, CHEMOMETR INTELL LAB, V73, P139, DOI 10.1016/j.chemolab.2003.11.013; Kitano H, 2004, DIABETES, V53, pS6, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.53.suppl_3.S6; Drews J, 2000, SCIENCE, V287, P1960, DOI 10.1126/science.287.5460.1960; van Dorp JR, 2006, MEDITERR J MATH, V3, P205; Ross PL, 2004, MOL CELL PROTEOMICS, V3, P1154, DOI 10.1074/mcp.M400129-MCP200; Bar-Yam Yaneer, 2004, MAKING THINGS WORK S; Bojowald M, 2006, NATURE, V442, P988, DOI 10.1038/442988a; Capra F, 1996, WEB LIFE; CLISH CB, 2004, OMICS, V1, P3; Davidov E, 2004, OMICS, V8, P267, DOI 10.1089/omi.2004.8.267; Davidov E., 2003, METABOLIC PROFILING, P170; Dostal E., 2005, BIOMATRIX SYSTEMS AP; Glass L., 1998, CLOCKS CHAOS RHYTHMS; He X., 2006, PLOS GENET, V2, p[1, e88]; Horvath G, 2005, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V22, P55, DOI 10.1002/sres.606; Hyman MA, 2006, ALTERN THER HEALTH M, V12, P10; MEUZELAA.HL, 1973, ANAL CHEM, V45, P587, DOI 10.1021/ac60325a051; KITANO H, 2002, NATURE, V421, P573; Laszlo E., 2003, CONNECTIVITY HYPOTHE; Laszlo E., 1996, SYSTEMS VIEW WORLD H; Misek DE, 2005, PROTEOMICS, V5, P3343, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200500103; Oresic Matej, 2004, Appl Bioinformatics, V3, P205; Pert C., 1997, MOL EMOTION; SMUTS JC, 1996, HOLISM EVOLUTION; TAS AC, 1985, J ANAL APPL PYROL, V7, P249, DOI 10.1016/0165-2370(85)80113-3; TAS AC, 1995, MASS SPECTROM REV, V13, P181; VANDENBERG RA, 2006, BMC GENOMICS, V8, P142; VANDERGREEF J, 1988, BIOMED ENVIRON MASS, V16, P45, DOI 10.1002/bms.1200160109; van der Greef J, 2005, IEE P SYST BIOL, V152, P174, DOI 10.1049/ip-syb:20050034; Verhoeckx KCM, 2004, INT IMMUNOPHARMACOL, V4, P1499, DOI 10.1016/j.intimp.2004.07.008; Von Bertalanffy Ludwig, 1968, GEN SYSTEMS THEORY F; WANG M, 2005, J PHYTOTHER RES, V19, P173",62,108,110,8,29,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1535-3893,,,J PROTEOME RES,J.

It introduces the different alternative system representations for linear systems and provides a quick review of the fundamental mathematical tools, which are essential for the treatment of the more advanced notions in Linear Systems. The paper focuses on some fundamental concepts under pinning the study of linear systems and dynamics and which play a crucial role in the analysis and design of control systems; thus, the paper deals with notions such as those of Controllability, Observability, Stability, poles and zeros and related dynamics and their properties under different compensation schemes. There is a concrete flavour in the current approach which runs through this presentation and this is that of the underlying algebraic structure. The term ""structure"" refers to aspects of the state space/transfer function description, which remain invariant under a variety of transformations. The set of transformations considered here are of the compensation type and include state feedback and output injection, dynamic compensation, as well as of the representation type transformations that include state, input, and output co-ordinate transformations. This structure stems from the system description and defines the nature of the dynamics and the related geometric properties and these in turn define what it is possible to achieve under feedback; such an approach is known as a structural approach. Central to our analysis are the notions of poles and zeros. The poles of a system are crucial characteristics of the internal system dynamics, character is e system free response, stability and general aspects of the performance of a system. The poles of a system are affected by the different compensation schemes and their assignment is the subject of many design methodologies aiming at shaping the internal system dynamics under different compensation schemes. The notion of zeros is more complex, since they express the interaction between internal dynamics and the effort to control and observe the system and they are thus products of overall system design, that a part from process synthesis involves selection of actuation and measurement schemes for the system. The significance of zeros is mainly due to that they remain invariant under a large set of compensation schemes, as well as that they define limits of what can be achieved under compensation. This makes zeros crucial for design, since they are part of those factors characterising the potential of a given system to achieve certain design objectives under compensation. The invariance of zeros implies that their design is an issue that has to be addressed outside the traditional control design; this requires understanding of the zero formation process and involves early design stages mechanisms such as process instrumentation. Poles and zeros are conceptually inverse concepts (resonances, antiresonances) and such mechanisms are highlighted throughout the paper. The role of system structure in characterising different system properties is central to this paper and it is defined by a set of discrete and continuous invariants; these invariants characterise a variety of key system properties and their type/values define the structure of canonical forms and determine some how the potential of a given system for compensation. Invariants and canonical forms under the general transformation group are linked to compensation theory, where as those associated with representation transformations play a keyrole in system identification. The emphasis in this article is to provide an overview of the fundamentals concepts, the background mathematical tools, explain their dynamic significance and link them to problems of control and systems design.","[Karcanias, Nicos; Milonidis, Efstathios] City Univ London, London EC1V 0HB, England","Karcanias, N (reprint author), City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",N.Karcanias@city.ac.uk; E.Milonidis@city.ac.uk,,,,,"KARCANIAS N, 1984, INT J CONTROL, V40, P673, DOI 10.1080/00207178408933300; MORSE AS, 1973, SIAM J CONTROL, V11, P446, DOI 10.1137/0311037; VERGHESE GC, 1981, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V26, P434, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1981.1102593; GIANNAKOPOULOS C, 1985, INT J CONTROL, V42, P543, DOI 10.1080/00207178508933382; KOUVARITAKIS B, 1976, INT J CONTROL, V23, P167, DOI 10.1080/00207177608922150; POPOV VM, 1972, SIAM J CONTROL, V10, P252, DOI 10.1137/0310020; VARDULAKIS AIG, 1982, INT J CONTROL, V35, P701, DOI 10.1080/00207178208922649; FORNEY GD, 1975, SIAM J CONTROL, V13, P493; WANG SH, 1976, SIAM J CONTROL, V14, P236, DOI 10.1137/0314018; SAFONOV MG, 1981, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V26, P47, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1981.1102566; LEVENTIDES J, 1995, AUTOMATICA, V31, P1303, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(95)00047-Z; POSTLETHWAITE I, 1981, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V26, P32, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1981.1102556; MACFARLANE AGJ, 1976, INT J CONTROL, V24, P33, DOI 10.1080/00207177608932805; Antsaklis P.

Because it has primarily been used to analyzing technique based on image processing through virtual pinhole and simple geometry excluded realistic optical properties. In this paper, we proposed the novel reconstruction technique using the micro-lens array designed and ray tracing including realistic environments and optical components in practical integral imaging system. As a theoretical background, the principle of the proposed method is described. To analyze the reconstruction system model, rays are traced by using the LightTools software. As a result, a 3-D image reconstructed by integrated rays in designed model is illustrated and some experimental results and system analysis are also presented as well.","[Lee, Jong-Kil; Kim, Seung-Cheol; Kim, Eun-Soo] Kwangwoon Univ, Display Res Ctr 3D, Natl Res Lab Media 3D, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, JK (reprint author), Kwangwoon Univ, Display Res Ctr 3D, Natl Res Lab Media 3D, Dept Elect Engn, 447-1 Wolge Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,"Arimoto H, 2001, OPT LETT, V26, P157, DOI 10.1364/OL.26.000157; Okano F, 1997, APPL OPTICS, V36, P1598, DOI 10.1364/AO.36.001598; Jang JS, 2002, OPT LETT, V27, P324, DOI 10.1364/OL.27.000324; Min SW, 2003, APPL OPTICS, V42, P4186, DOI 10.1364/AO.42.004186; Hong SH, 2004, OPT EXPRESS, V12, P483, DOI 10.1364/OPEX.12.000483; Naemura T, 2001, OPT EXPRESS, V8, P255; CHOI HJ, OPTICS EXPRESS, V14, P5183; FRANK L, INTRO OPTICS; Lippmann G, 1908, CR HEBD ACAD SCI, V146, P446; PARK JS, 2006, APPL DIGITAL IMAGE P, V34, pP3121; Shin DH, 2005, JPN J APPL PHYS 1, V44, P8016, DOI 10.1143/JJAP.44.8016; Shin DH, 2005, ETRI J, V27, P289, DOI 10.4218/etrij.05.0104.0145; Shin DH, 2005, ETRI J, V27, P708, DOI 10.4218/etrij.05.0104.0194",13,1,1,1,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6843-7,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,6695,,,,,,69519,69519,,10.1117/12.733361,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Computer Science; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BGY50,WOS:000251356900035,S,"Tirimaidoka, L; Waqa, N; Masamdu, R",,"Ragone, D; Taylor, MB",,"Tirimaidoka, Luke; Waqa, Nacanieli; Masamdu, Roy",,,Systems approach to improve breadfruit exports in Fiji,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BREADFRUIT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,ACTA HORTICULTURAE,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Symposium on Breadfruit Research and Development,"APR 16-19, 2007","Nadi, FIJI","EU ACP Tech Ctr Agr & Rural Cooperat, Secretariat Pacific Community, Land Resources Div, Breadfruit Inst, Natl Trop Bot Garden, Int Ctr Underutilised Crops, Global Cacilitat Unit Underutilized Species, Global Crop Divers Trust, German Agcy Tech Cooperat",,Artocarpus altilis; plant quarantine; high temperature forced air; tropical fruit,,"A systems approach for breadfruit production and marketing is discussed.

We then use System Dynamics modeling technique to capture the causality relationships and feedback loops in the workforce supply chain with the merit of system thinking. The evaluation of System Dynamics-based simulation exposes dynamic behavior and workforce management system and shows how adaptive control can be applied to such system.","[An, Lianjun; Jeng, Jun-Jang; Lee, Young M.] IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","An, LJ (reprint author), IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",,,,,,"Hafeez K, 2003, J OPER RES SOC, V54, P153, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601513; Rodrigues A, 1996, SYST DYNAM REV, V12, P121, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199622)12:2<121::AID-SDR99>3.0.CO;2-X; Rodrigues AG, 1998, J OPER RES SOC, V49, P2, DOI 10.1038/sj.jors.2600490; Winch G, 1999, J OPER RES SOC, V50, P354, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600648; BRYANT DJ, 1978, MANPOWER PLANNING OR; Coyle RG, 1996, SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODE; DELLACCA D, 2007, P 40 ANN HAW INT C S; Forrester J.

The question is a central part in a Danish research project that focuses on studying the correlation between controlled stresses as a part of the production strategy for improving the post harvest performance (external and internal quality). However, we also aim to obtain a systems approach also design models for post harvest performance and software for analysing these relations. The greenhouse's climate computer collects all information about the environment during crop production. Hence, development of software support for performing the analysis is needed, which includes interfacing the greenhouse's climate computer and the observations of plant characteristics during the post-harvest phase. To generate further information plants from commercial nurseries were subjected to forced keeping quality tests and climate data analysed in relation to post harvest performance. To analyse these connections we have developed a preliminary model for prediction of keeping quality and a set of applications, which together form an analysis platform. Data for environmental factors are extracted from the greenhouse's climate computer. The keeping quality observations are entered into a relational database using a WiFi PDA. The system provides a flexible platform, which effectively facilitates the analysis of the effect of controlled stress on the post harvest performance. The results indicate that even severe stress conditions and mismanagement during production have surprisingly small effect on the post harvest compared to in the shipping chain.","Univ Aarhus, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Hort, DK-5729 Arslev, Denmark","Ottosen, CO (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Hort, Kirstinebjergvej 10, DK-5729 Arslev, Denmark.",,,,,,"Williams MH, 2000, POSTHARVEST BIOL TEC, V18, P143, DOI 10.1016/S0925-5214(99)00076-9; Bulle A, 2005, ACTA HORTIC, V669, P263; Hansen C.W., 2005, ACTA HORTIC, V669, P269; Hoyer L., 2001, ACTA HORTIC, V543, P119; KORNER OPS, 2006, ACTA HORTIC, V718, P647; Marissen N., 2005, ACTA HORTIC, V669, P255; Marissen N., 2001, ACTA HORTIC, V543, P285; Marissen N, 2001, ACTA HORTIC, V543, P331; Mortensen LM, 2001, SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM, V90, P131, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4238(00)00251-X; Nielsen B, 1999, POSTHARVEST BIOL TEC, V16, P157, DOI 10.1016/S0925-5214(99)00015-0; Silber A, 2007, AGR WATER MANAGE, V87, P162, DOI 10.1016/j.agwat.2006.06.022; Slootweg G., 2005, ACTA HORTIC, V669, P297; Starkey K.R., 2005, ACTA HORTIC, V669, P283; Starkey KR, 2000, J HORTIC SCI BIOTECH, V75, P251",14,0,0,0,2,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-600-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2007,755,,,,,,33,38,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Agriculture,BHK10,WOS:000253705600002,B,"Vanasupa, L; Chen, KC; Splitt, FG",,"Baglin, JEE",,"Vanasupa, Linda; Chen, Katherine C.; Splitt, Frank G.",,,Classroom techniques to promote engineering solutions for a sustainable future,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE SYMPOSIUM AND FORUM EDUCATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY",,,English,Proceedings Paper,3rd International Conference on Materials for Advanced Technologies (ICMAT-2005)/9th International Conference on Advanced Materials (ICAM 2005),"JUL 03-08, 2005","Singapore, SINGAPORE","Int Union Mat Res Soc, Mat Res Soc Singapore, Suntec Int Convent & Exhibit Ctr",,,,"In ""Tracking the Ecological Overshoot of the Human Economy,"" Wackernagel et al.

Additionally, technological developments have damaged critical environmental components of the biosphere through toxicogenic materials and processes. Much of the global scientific community has answered the call to ensure quality of life for future generations: Japan has implemented a nation-wide effort in lifecycle assessment of processes and products; the European Union has adopted policies that promote responsible product development by manufacturers; China has made a commitment to sustainable development; and the U.K. has implemented a national sustainability education initiative throughout their system. To assist in the rapid conversion to sustainable activities, the materials science and engineering community can play a critical role by developing materials and processes that are environmentally benign. However, the complexity of sustainable solutions requires a systems approach and a breadth of knowledge that extends beyond the traditional boundaries of materials science and engineering. In short, it requires a different way of thinking. In this paper, we present classroom techniques that we have used throughout our curriculum to instill the kind of systems thinking, global awareness and mindset that is needed for sustainable engineering solutions. We will also present preliminary data on how these activities have influenced students' thinking.","[Vanasupa, Linda; Chen, Katherine C.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Mat Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",,,,,,,"Anderson V., 1997, SYSTEMS THINKING BAS; Wackernagel M, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P9266, DOI 10.1073/pnas.142033699; Benyus J, 1997, BIOMIMICRY INNOVATIO; BRACKIN P, P 2002 ASEE C; Capra F., 2002, HIDDEN CONNECTIONS S; *ENG ACCR COMM, 2005, CRIT ACCR ENG PROGR, P2; Fairley P., 2002, TECHNOLOGY REV   JAN, P48; FAIRLEY P, 2004, TECHNOLOGY REV   APR, P34; Fromm E., 2003, J ENG EDUC, V92, P113, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2003.tb00749.x; *GEN ASS UN, 2002, WORLD SUMM SUST DEV; GOODSTEIN D, 2004, OUT GAS END AGE OIL, P128; HAWKINS P, 1999, NATURAL CAPITALISM C, P19; HOAGLAND, 1995, SCI AM           SEP; Honnet E., PRINCIPLES GOOD PRAC; LEMLEY B, 2001, DISCOVER         NOV, P53; McDonough W., 2002, CRADLE CRADLE REMAKI; National Academy of Engineering, 2004, HYDR EC OPP COSTS BA; RICHMOND B, 1993, SYST DYNAM REV, V9, P113, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260090203; Senge P.M., 1990, 5 DISCIPLINE ART PRA; SLIVOVSKY LA, 2003, P 33 ASEE IEEE FRONT; Splitt F.

Crop improvement can be viewed as a search strategy on a complex G x M x E adaptation or fitness landscape. Here we consider design of an integrated systems approach to crop improvement that incorporates advanced technologies in molecular markers, statistics, bio-informatics, and crop physiology and modelling. We suggest that such an approach can enhance the efficiency of crop improvement relative to conventional phenotypic selection by changing the focus from the paradigm of identifying superior varieties to a focus on identifying superior combinations of genetic regions and management systems. A comprehensive information system to support decisions on identifying target combinations is the critical core of the approach. We discuss the role of ecophysiology and modelling in this integrated systems approach by reviewing (i) applications in environmental characterization to underpin weighted selection; (ii) complex-trait physiology and genetics to enhance the stability of QTL models by linking the vector of coefficients defining the dynamic model to the genetic regions generating variability; and (iii) phenotypic prediction in the target population of environments to assess the value of putative combinations of traits and management systems and enhance the utility of QTL models in selection. We examine in silico evidence of the value of ecophysiology and modelling to crop improvement for complex traits and note that, while there is no definitive position, it seems clear that there is sufficient promise to warrant continued effort. We discuss criteria determining the nature of models required and argue that a greater degree of biological robustness is required for modelling the physiology and genetics of complex traits. We conclude that, while an integrated systems approach to crop improvement is in its infancy, we expect that the potential benefits and further technology developments will Rely enhance its rate of development.","[Hammer, G.

To maximize the productivity of a manufacturing system, its entire complexity must be reduced. Many valid methods have been developed so far addressing different single manufacturing and quality issues. But to continuously increase the productivity of a manufacturing system within a turbulent environment its entire complexity must be reduced. This requires a holistic understanding and knowledge about the system. To reduce a system's complexity, its subsystems should not overlap in their contribution to the overall system's functionality, they must be mutually exclusive. On the other hand, the interplay of system's components must be collectively exhaustive in order to include every issue relevant to the entire system's functionality. This paper introduces a concept for complexity reduction in manufacturing systems with the help of Nam P. Suit's Axiomatic Design principles. In a first step, time-dependent elements are separated from time-independent elements. To eliminate the real complexity of the time-independent elements (so called manufacturing modules), a set of alternative design parameters are defined that fit the system range of the manufacturing module's set of functional requirements. To reduce the time-dependent combinatorial complexity, a methodology is proposed to systematically define an entire manufacturing system's functional requirements within very short times in order to guarantee a fast reconfiguration of the system considering internal and external system dynamics. With the help of practical examples and the obtained results, the validity of the approach is illustrated.","Politecn Torino, Dept Prod Syst & Business Econ, I-10129 Turin, Italy","Matt, DT (reprint author), Politecn Torino, Dept Prod Syst & Business Econ, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",dominik.matt@polito.it,,"Matt, Dominik/0000-0002-2365-7529",,,"Bar-Yam Y., 1997, DYNAMICS COMPLEX SYS; Blecker T., 2004, 2 INT C ENT OD BUILD, P890; LEE T, 2006, ICAD06 J INT C AX DE; MATT DT, 2006, CIRP ICME06 INT C IN, P373; Simon H.

Enterprise modelling has its roots in control system design. Simulation modelling has generally been used in re-engineering and optimizing production and service processes, whereas causal loop diagramming (systems thinking) has generally been used for systems designing in management and social sciences. This paper describes the combined use of these three modelling approaches which carry complementary concepts that can be used together for supporting management decisions in designing and changing complex manufacturing enterprises. A decision support framework is presented that is instrumented with combined use of these three modelling approaches and has been tested in production management-related decision making.","Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Opposite Sector U, Def Housing Author, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan; Univ Loughborough, Mfg Syst Integrat Res Inst, Loughborough, Leics, England","Chatha, KA (reprint author), Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Opposite Sector U, Def Housing Author, Lahore Cantt, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.",kamranali@lums.edu.pk,,,,,"Ackerman L, 1997, ORG DEV CLASSICS; Iassinovski S, 2003, INT J PROD ECON, V85, P3, DOI 10.1016/S0925-5273(03)00082-3; Hayes RH, 1998, CALIF MANAGE REV, V40, P8; BAHRAMI A, 1998, P 1998 WINT SIM C 13; BLANCHARD B.

An application of the SEIPS model in one particular care setting (outpatient surgery) is presented and other practical and research applications of the model are described.","Univ Wisconsin, Coll Engn, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Ctr Qual & Prod Improvement, Madison, WI 53726 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Nursing, Madison, WI USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Anesthesiol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Carayon, P (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Engn, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Ctr Qual & Prod Improvement, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",carayon@engr.wisc.edu,,,,,"Sexton JB, 2000, BRIT MED J, V320, P745, DOI 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.745; Wilson JR, 2000, APPL ERGON, V31, P557, DOI 10.1016/S0003-6870(00)00034-X; DONABEDIAN A, 1978, SCIENCE, V200, P856, DOI 10.1126/science.417400; Brasel KJ, 2000, ACAD EMERG MED, V7, P1298, DOI 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2000.tb00479.x; DONABEDIAN A, 1966, MILBANK FUND Q, V44, P166, DOI 10.2307/3348969; LEAPE LL, 1995, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V274, P35, DOI 10.1001/jama.274.1.35; Gaba DM, 2000, BRIT MED J, V320, P785, DOI 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.785; Coyle YM, 1999, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V11, P5, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/11.1.5; Morey JC, 2002, HEALTH SERV RES, V37, P1553, DOI 10.1111/1475-6773.01104; Carayon P, 2000, APPL ERGON, V31, P649, DOI 10.1016/S0003-6870(00)00040-5; DONABEDIAN A, 1988, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V260, P1743, DOI 10.1001/jama.260.12.1743; Vincent C, 1998, BRIT MED J, V316, P1154; Brennan PF, 2004, INT J MED INFORM, V73, P547, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.05.005; LEAPE LL, 1994, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V272, P1851, DOI 10.1001/jama.272.23.1851; Carayon P, 2006, ERGONOMICS, V49, P470, DOI 10.1080/00140130600568717; Flynn EA, 2002, AM J HEALTH-SYST PH, V59, P436; Battles JB, 2003, QUAL SAF HLTH CAR S2, V12, pii2; Carayon P, 2005, CHANGE QUALITY HUMAN, P257; Carayon P., 2005, ADV PATIENT SAFETY R, P461; Carayon P, 2007, HDB HUMAN FACTORS ER, P61; Carayon Pascale, 2004, Jt Comm J Qual Saf, V30, P405; CARAYON P, 2003, 15 TRIENN C INT ERG; Carayon P., 2005, ADV PATIENT SAFETY R, P305; CARAYON P, 2003, REDUCING WORKLOAD IN; DONABEDIAN A, 1980, DEFINITION QUALITY A; Flynn KE, 2002, MED CARE RES REV, V59, P455, DOI 10.1177/107755802237811; Sox HC, 2002, ANN INTERN MED, V136, P243; Freidson E., 1970, PROFESSION MED STUDY; Grandjean E., 1980, FITTING TASK MAN ERG; HUNDT AS, 2005, ADV PATIENT SAFETY R, P445; Institute of Medicine, 2001, CROSS QUAL CHASM NEW; Institute of Medicine, 2004, KEEP PAT SAF TRANSF; Institute of Medicine, 1999, ERR IS HUM BUILD SAF; Keijsers GJ, 1995, WORK STRESS, V9, P513, DOI 10.1080/02678379508256897; Kovner C, 2001, Jt Comm J Qual Improv, V27, P458; Murphy L.

The study examined a database of 5542 admissions for in-patient detoxification between 1995 and 2003, which permitted the analysis of changes occurring in the composition of the client group after the adoption of the new model. Findings suggest that working with the systems approach resulted in more effective targeting of people with higher levels of alcohol dependency towards in-patient detoxification. Females and people in stable housing also benefited from increased access in the new system. Increases in planned discharges were observed across all demographic variables, although alcohol-dependent males without stable accommodation found it more difficult to access in-patient detoxification after the new model was introduced. We conclude that in comparison to a loose network of services a co-ordinated and managed service system can improve targeting for in-patient detoxification for most people with severe alcohol dependence but may not do so for all who need access.

Species richness within Everglades National Park, at the southern extreme of the Greater Everglades ecosystem, is 1033 plant taxa, 60 reptile taxa, 76 mammal taxa, 432 fish taxa, 349 bird taxa and 38 amphibian taxa. This paper briefly introduces the flora and fauna of the Greater Everglades, focusing on species of special conservation concern and those non-native species that are altering native ecology. While there is conservation utility in cataloging biodiversity, we argue that counts of species alone are inadequate descriptors of ecosystem condition because they fail to effectively indicate emergent ecosystem properties (resilience, productivity). We develop an approach to calculating biodiversity based on systems theory that can be applied across trophic levels to provide a condition benchmark that accounts for food web interactions. The Everglades, for which detailed flow data between ecosystem components have been compiled as part of ongoing modeling efforts (DeAngelis et al., 1998), is among the few ecosystems globally for which this technique is currently feasible. Flow data are coupled with exogenous forcing energies (in emergy units - Odum, 1996) to compute transformity values (Odum, 1988) for biotic and abiotic components of an Everglades graminoid marsh community. We calculate across-trophic level biodiversity using the Shannon information equation applied to ecosystem emergy flows. Results suggest that the graminoid marsh is operating at 42% of theoretical maximum ecosystem flow diversity. By comparing observed flows with theoretical maximum flows, we provide a measure of component conservation value; we observe strong overlap between species with lower than expected emergy-based importance and those known to be currently threatened or endangered. A significant positive association between this conservation value and transformity in the marsh suggests systematic uppertrophic level biodiversity degradation.","Univ Florida, Ctr Environm Policy, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Brown, MT (reprint author), Univ Florida, Ctr Environm Policy, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",mtb@ufl.edu,"Cohen, Matthew/F-7117-2013; ","Ingwersen, Wesley/0000-0002-9614-701X",,,"Alsop III F.J, 2001, BIRDS N AM E REGION; Heymans JJ, 2002, ECOL MODEL, V149, P5, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3800(01)00511-7; Fagan WF, 1997, BIOL CONSERV, V80, P249, DOI 10.1016/S0006-3207(96)00144-9; ULANOWICZ RE, 1980, J THEOR BIOL, V85, P223, DOI 10.1016/0022-5193(80)90019-3; Terborgh J, 2001, SCIENCE, V294, P1923, DOI 10.1126/science.1064397; DeAngelis DL, 1998, ECOSYSTEMS, V1, P64, DOI 10.1007/s100219900006; MARGALEF R, 1961, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V6, P124; Turner AM, 1999, CONSERV BIOL, V13, P898, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.97513.x; MACARTHUR R, 1955, ECOLOGY, V36, P533, DOI 10.2307/1929601; DAME RF, 1981, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V5, P115, DOI 10.3354/meps005115; TILMAN D, 1994, NATURE, V367, P363, DOI 10.1038/367363a0; ANGERMEIER PL, 1994, BIOSCIENCE, V44, P690, DOI 10.2307/1312512; Worm B, 2003, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V18, P628, DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2003.09.003; Brown MT, 1996, ECOL ECON, V19, P219, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00046-8; Pandolfi JM, 2003, SCIENCE, V301, P955, DOI 10.1126/science.1085706; ODUM HT, 1955, AM SCI, V43, P331; Schwartz MW, 2000, OECOLOGIA, V122, P297, DOI 10.1007/s004420050035; MARES MA, 1992, SCIENCE, V255, P976, DOI 10.1126/science.255.5047.976; Avery G.N., 1980, T558 US NAT PARK SER; AVERY GN, 1983, T574 US NATL PARK SE; Bardi E., 2005, EMERGY SYNTHESIS, P63; Berner L., 1988, MAYFLIES FLORIDA; Brown LN, 1997, MAMMALS FLORIDA; Brown MT, 2001, HDB EMERGY EVALUATIO; CHRISTENSEN V, 1994, ECOL MODEL, V72, P129, DOI 10.1016/0304-3800(94)90148-1; Davis J.

But strong evidences of effective group selection seem impossible, at least in vertebrates. However, understanding the origin of social systems adaptivity based on individual selection is difficult, as well, without analyzing the proximal mechanisms of the formation of such systems. I suppose that social systems change due to changes of individual features that underlie the proximal mechanisms of the system formation. These features are the characteristics of neurophysiological and hormonal regulatory mechanisms. They are strongly associated with intrinsic biochemical processes and are coded in the genome. Thus, the evolution of social systems is the evolution of their proximal mechanisms. At the same time, the specificity of neurophysiological and hormonal regulation determines not only social interactions, but also the individual behaviour of animals. The most important characteristics of life history, such as the regime of activity, foraging strategy, etc., are strongly affected by the same regulatory mechanisms. This view is useful for understanding the relations combining many features into an integrated and adaptive species-specific life form. I suppose that such forms emerged as evolutionary consequences of changes in regulatory mechanisms adaptive to specific environment. Thus, we have as substantial reasons to discuss adaptations of social systems to ecological features as to discuss ecological features adapted to particular social systems. The species-specificity of regulatory mechanisms is probably based on different kinds of evolutionary choice between the rapidity and the perfection of adaptation, between flexibility and stability, and between sensibility and resistibility. I think that this choice depends largely on the predictability of the environment. The less predictable it is, the more it increases the selective value of sensibility, flexibility, and rapidity of evolution. On the contrary, stable and predictable environment stimulates less rapid but more perfect adaptations. Such choices consolidate in the genom during evolution as specific features of neurophysiological and hormonal regulation systems. These specific features, in their turn, determine ecological, behavioural, and physiological species-specificity. From this point of view, evolutionary changes in social systems can be readily perceived as consequences of the selection of individuals, promoting optimal properties under particular conditional features of regulation systems. The boundary condition for this model is the absence of specificity of the characteristics of regulation systems to different forms of stress. This condition needs to be considered closely.","Moscow Zoo, Dept Res, Moscow 123242, Russia","Popov, SV (reprint author), Moscow Zoo, Dept Res, Bolshaya Gruzinskaya Ul 1, Moscow 123242, Russia.",zoosci@cdt.ru,,,,,"ABBOTT DH, 1989, J ZOOL, V219, P703; CHROUSOS GP, 1982, P NATL ACAD SCI-BIOL, V79, P2036, DOI 10.1073/pnas.79.6.2036; WINSLOW JT, 1993, PSYCHOPHARMACOL BULL, V29, P409; BOISSY A, 1995, Q REV BIOL, V70, P165, DOI 10.1086/418981; WINSLOW JT, 1991, J NEUROSCI, V11, P2032; CARTER CS, 1992, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V652, P204, DOI 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb34356.x; INSEL TR, 1992, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V89, P5981, DOI 10.1073/pnas.89.13.5981; FLEMING AS, 1981, PHYSIOL BEHAV, V27, P863, DOI 10.1016/0031-9384(81)90054-8; von Holst D, 1998, ADV STUD BEHAV, V27, P1; INSEL TR, 1992, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINO, V17, P3, DOI 10.1016/0306-4530(92)90073-G; Popov SV, 2005, ZOOL ZH, V84, P4; Uvnas-Moberg K, 1998, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINO, V23, P819, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00056-0; SHAPIRO LE, 1986, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V18, P267, DOI 10.1007/BF00300003; LEWONTIN RC, 1979, BEHAV SCI, V24, P5, DOI 10.1002/bs.3830240103; Young LJ, 1999, HORM BEHAV, V36, P212, DOI 10.1006/hbeh.1999.1548; HINDE RA, 1976, MAN, V11, P1, DOI 10.2307/2800384; Insel TR, 1997, AM J PSYCHIAT, V154, P726; BOELLSTORFF DE, 1995, J MAMMAL, V76, P551, DOI 10.2307/1382363; MASON JW, 1971, J PSYCHIAT RES, V8, P323, DOI 10.1016/0022-3956(71)90028-8; SHAPIRO LE, 1990, J COMP PSYCHOL, V104, P268, DOI 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.268; TRAVIS SE, 1995, ECOLOGY, V76, P1794, DOI 10.2307/1940711; WECHSLER B, 1995, APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI, V43, P123, DOI 10.1016/0168-1591(95)00557-9; WILLIAMS JR, 1994, J NEUROENDOCRINOL, V6, P247, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2826.1994.tb00579.x; GETZ LL, 1981, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V8, P189, DOI 10.1007/BF00299829; Hayes LD, 2000, ANIM BEHAV, V59, P677, DOI 10.1006/anbe.1999.1390; WILLIAMS JR, 1992, HORM BEHAV, V26, P339, DOI 10.1016/0018-506X(92)90004-F; ARNOLD W, 1992, 4 INT BEH EC C 1992, V1; BARNARD CJ, 1995, 24 INT ETH C HON, P26; BRUSH FR, 1991, EXPERIENTIA, V47, P1039, DOI 10.1007/BF01923339; Carter C.

While there is much research dedicated to designing sensors to detect airborne toxic contaminants, little research has addressed how to incorporate such sensors into a monitoring system designed to protect building occupants. To design sensor systems, one must quantify design tradeoffs, such as response time and accuracy, and select values to optimize the performance of an overall system. We illustrate the importance of a systems approach for properly evaluating such tradeoffs, using data from tracer gas experiments conducted in a three-floor building at the Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah. We explore how well a Bayesian interpretation approach can characterize an indoor release using threshold sensor data. We use this approach to assess the effects of various sensor characteristics, such as response time, threshold level, and accuracy, on overall system performance. The system performance is evaluated in terms of the time needed to characterize the release (location, amount released, and duration). We demonstrate that a systems perspective enables selecting sensor characteristics that optimize the system as a whole. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the recent postgenomic era, the accumulation of an enormous amount of data gained from a variety of technologies has led to a revisiting of systems theory concepts. This systems biology approach has been integral in understanding a variety of processes in a number of model organisms. This review gives an overview of systems biology approaches, from component identification to modeling of networks. Various features of the root, including its development and the availability of high resolution gene expression data sets that describe root development, make the root amenable to a systems approach. The current status of systems approaches to understanding root development is reviewed.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Benfey, PN (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",philip.benfey@duke.edu,,,,,"Mendoza L, 1999, BIOINFORMATICS, V15, P593, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/15.7.593; Chen KC, 2000, MOL BIOL CELL, V11, P369; Sessions A, 2002, PLANT CELL, V14, P2985, DOI 10.1105/tpc.004630; Kohn KW, 2005, BIOCHEM BIOPH RES CO, V331, P816, DOI 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.186; Barabasi AL, 1999, SCIENCE, V286, P509, DOI 10.1126/science.286.5439.509; Vilar JMG, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P5988, DOI 10.1073/pnas.092133899; Schmid M, 2005, NAT GENET, V37, P501, DOI 10.1038/ng1543; Keller EF, 2005, BIOESSAYS, V27, P1060, DOI 10.1002/bies.20294; Nikiforova VJ, 2005, PLANT PHYSIOL, V138, P304, DOI 10.1104/pp.104.053793; Aida M, 2004, CELL, V119, P109, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.018; Wolf YI, 2002, BIOESSAYS, V24, P105, DOI 10.1002/bies.10059; Rives AW, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P1128, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0237338100; Poroyko V, 2005, PLANT PHYSIOL, V138, P1700, DOI 10.1104/pp.104.057638; May BP, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P11541, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1831119100; Bork P, 2004, CURR OPIN STRUC BIOL, V14, P292, DOI 10.1016/j.sbi.2004.05.003; Vanneste S, 2005, PLANT CELL, V17, P3035, DOI 10.1105/tpc.105.035493; Nikiforova VJ, 2004, J EXP BOT, V55, P1861, DOI 10.1093/jxb/erh177; Woll K, 2005, PLANT PHYSIOL, V139, P1255, DOI 10.1104/pp.105.067330; Provart NJ, 2004, CURR OPIN PLANT BIOL, V7, P605, DOI 10.1016/j.pbi.2004.07.001; Kauffman S, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P14796, DOI 10.1073/pnas.2036429100; Alonso JM, 2003, SCIENCE, V301, P653, DOI 10.1126/science.1086391; Goff SA, 2002, SCIENCE, V296, P92, DOI 10.1126/science.1068275; Nuhse TS, 2004, PLANT CELL, V16, P2394, DOI 10.1105/tpc.104.023150; Locke JCW, 2005, J THEOR BIOL, V234, P383, DOI 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.038; Wuchty S, 2004, GENOME RES, V14, P1310, DOI 10.1101/gr.2300204; Hatzimanikatis V, 2004, CURR OPIN STRUC BIOL, V14, P300, DOI 10.1016/j.sbi.2004.04.004; Dolan L, 2006, J EXP BOT, V57, P51, DOI 10.1093/jxb/erj037; Friedman N, 2000, J COMPUT BIOL, V7, P601, DOI 10.1089/106652700750050961; Kohn KW, 1999, MOL BIOL CELL, V10, P2703; Fizames C, 2004, PLANT PHYSIOL, V134, P67, DOI 10.1104/pp.103.030536; Ideker T, 2001, ANNU REV GENOM HUM G, V2, P343, DOI 10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.343; Himanen K, 2004, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V101, P5146, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0308702101; Rabinowicz PD, 2005, GENOME RES, V15, P1431, DOI 10.1101/gr.4100405; Yu J, 2002, SCIENCE, V296, P79, DOI 10.1126/science.1068037; Schiefelbein J, 2003, CURR OPIN PLANT BIOL, V6, P74, DOI 10.1016/S136952660200002X; William DA, 2004, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V101, P1775, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0307842100; Gomez-Mena C, 2005, DEVELOPMENT, V132, P429, DOI 10.1242/dev.01600; Swidzinski JA, 2004, PHYTOCHEMISTRY, V65, P1829, DOI 10.1016/j.phytochem.2004.04.020; Birnbaum K, 2003, SCIENCE, V302, P1956, DOI 10.1126/science.1090022; Nawy T, 2005, PLANT CELL, V17, P1908, DOI 10.1105/tpc.105.031724; An SY, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V133, P2040, DOI 10.1104/pp.103.030478; Xia Y, 2004, ANNU REV BIOCHEM, V73, P1051, DOI 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073950; Birnbaum K, 2004, CURR OPIN PLANT BIOL, V7, P582, DOI 10.1016/j.pbi.2004.07.010; Hartemink A.

The control law is derived using system theory and an implicit function theorem. A neural network with a linear filter is used to approximate the control law. The neural controller is trained using offline (finite interval of time) and online learning strategies. The neural controller was trained offline using the error signal between the aircraft response and pilot command (reference model). The offline-trained neural controller provides the necessary damping and tracking performances. The neural controller is adapted online for variations in aerodynamic coefficients or control surface deficiencies caused by control surface damage. A discrete time linear dynamic longitudinal model of a high-performance aircraft (F-8) is considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The performance results of the proposed control scheme are compared with the recently developed dynamic inversion technique and fully tuned radial basis function network. The neural controller performance is also evaluated for steady climb-and-hold maneuver in a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model.,"Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Suresh, S (reprint author), Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",,"Sundaram, Suresh/A-4026-2010",,,,"Calise AJ, 1996, IEEE AERO EL SYS MAG, V11, P5, DOI 10.1109/62.533965; Shtessel Y, 1999, J GUID CONTROL DYNAM, V22, P873, DOI 10.2514/2.4465; BARRON AR, 1993, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V39, P930, DOI 10.1109/18.256500; Li Y, 2001, AUTOMATICA, V37, P1293, DOI 10.1016/S0005-1098(01)00090-5; Lewis FL, 1996, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V7, P388, DOI 10.1109/72.485674; Polycarpou MM, 1996, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V41, P447, DOI 10.1109/9.486648; Suresh S, 2005, J GUID CONTROL DYNAM, V28, P1103, DOI 10.2514/1.12974; Calise AJ, 1998, IEEE CONTR SYST MAG, V18, P14, DOI 10.1109/37.736008; Narendra KS, 1996, P IEEE, V84, P1385, DOI 10.1109/5.537106; Suresh S, 2003, AEROSP SCI TECHNOL, V7, P595, DOI 10.1016/S1270-9638(03)00053-1; Leitner J, 1997, J GUID CONTROL DYNAM, V20, P972, DOI 10.2514/2.4142; Zhang YM, 2003, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V39, P838; HORNIK K, 1989, NEURAL NETWORKS, V2, P359, DOI 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8; CHEN FC, 1990, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, VOLS 1-6, P1707; WERBOS PJ, 1990, P IEEE, V78, P1550, DOI 10.1109/5.58337; SANNER RM, 1992, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V3, P837, DOI 10.1109/72.165588; HUNT KJ, 1992, AUTOMATICA, V28, P1083, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(92)90053-I; Kim BS, 1997, J GUID CONTROL DYNAM, V20, P26, DOI 10.2514/2.4029; Astrom K.

The main focus of the mechatronic approach is to extend and to complete the design process of mechanical and more general engineering systems by incorporating from the very beginning sensors and controllers - which includes also the required information processing - and thus being able to generate partly intelligent products. The components and modules of such systems originate from mechanical engineering, from electrical engineering or from other engineering domains. Methods for describing and designing these components and modules are based in the fields of applied mechanics, electrical engineering, system theory, control and automation theory, and information processing. In particular, in mechatronic systems like robots, manipulation systems, machine tools, or all kinds of vehicles, the multibody systems approach offers a powerful tool to model the mechanical properties of the system in an appropriate manner. In this paper, methodologies for the development of formalisms and software for modeling and simulation of multibody and mechatronic systems will be presented and illustrated by examples from automotive systems and robotics.

The support engineering disciplines, such as Reliability and Supportability engineering, are often found added-on to the tail-end of the design effort. In order to maximize operational effectiveness within today's cost and schedule constraints, reliability engineering needs to be a part of the up-front systems engineering effort on a program. Once in systems engineering, the role of reliability engineering needs to address the programs key TPMs (Technical Performance Metrics) within real-life operational scenarios. For example, a ship at sea changes its equipment configurations depending upon what mission it is performing at the time. At various points in time, the ship could be in-port, steaming to a new location, operating a specific mission, and then steaming to another location while picking-up supplies at mid-ocean before proceeding to another mission. In order to have the RMA (Reliability Maintainability Availability) engineering effort affect the ship's system design, RMA Monte Carlo modeling was used in the early system design stages to optimize Ao (operational Availability) with respect to system configuration, on-board spares and corrective maintenance hour allocations. The value of this paper to the RMA community is to show a case history where there were very positive results by having RMA engineering in a systems engineering design role on a program.","Raytheon Co, Network Cent Syst, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA","Dzekevich, JA (reprint author), Raytheon Co, Network Cent Syst, 1001 Boston Post Rd,Mail Stop 3-2-3565, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0149-144X,,978-1-4244-0007-2,P REL MAINT S,,,2006,,,,,,,661,664,,,,4,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Statistics & Probability",Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BGT51,WOS:000250419100108,J,"Kavakli, E; Kalloniatis, C; Loucopoulos, P; Gritzalis, S",,,,"Kavakli, E; Kalloniatis, C; Loucopoulos, P; Gritzalis, S",,,Incorporating privacy requirements into the system design process - The PriS conceptual framework,INTERNET RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,privacy; systems software,SECURITY; CONNECTIONS,"Purpose - To present a new methodology for incorporating privacy requirements into the system design process called PriS, and describe its applicability in the e-VOTE system for presenting methodology's way-of-working. Design/methodology/approach - PriS is a requirement engineering methodology focused on privacy issues. It provides a set of concepts for modelling privacy requirements (anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability and unobservability) in the organisation domain and a systematic way-of-working for translating these requirements into system models. The conceptual model used in PriS is based on the Enterprise Knowledge Development (EKD) framework. PriS models privacy requirements as a special type of goal. Findings - Based on the analysis of a number of well-known privacy-enhancing technologies as well as of existing security requirement engineering methodologies, this paper pinpoints the gap between system design methodologies and technological solutions. To this end, PriS is suggested, with a view to providing a methodological framework for matching privacy-related requirements with the proper implementation techniques. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new methodology for addressing privacy requirements during the design process. It guides developers to choose the most appropriate implementation techniques for realising the identified privacy issues. PriS methodology has a high degree of applicability on Internet systems that wish to provide services that ensure users privacy, such as anonymous browsing, untraceable transactions, etc.","Univ Aegean, Dept Cultural Technol & Commun, Mitilini, Greece; Univ Manchester, Sch Informat, Manchester, Lancs, England; Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Samos, Greece","Kalloniatis, C (reprint author), Univ Aegean, Dept Cultural Technol & Commun, Mitilini, Greece.",ch.Kalloniatis@ct.aegean.gr,,"Loucopoulos, Pericles/0000-0003-1395-5001",,,"MYLOPOULOS J, 1992, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V18, P483, DOI 10.1109/32.142871; Reiter MK, 1999, COMMUN ACM, V42, P32, DOI 10.1145/293411.293778; van Lamsweerde A, 2000, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V26, P978, DOI 10.1109/32.879820; Liu L, 2003, 11TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS, P151; Mouratidis H, 2003, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V2773, P1387; Goldschlag D, 1999, COMMUN ACM, V42, P39, DOI 10.1145/293411.293443; Dingledine R., 2004, Proceedings of the 13th USENIX Security Symposium; ANTON AI, 2000, 1 ACM WORKSH SEC PRI; ANTON AI, 1996, ICRE 96 P 2 INT C RE, P136; Bellotti V., 1993, P 3 EUR C COMP SUPP; BENNETT K, 2003, P WORKSH PET 2003 PR; CANNON CJ, 2004, PRIVACY WHAT DEV IT, P9; Chaum D., 1988, Journal of Cryptology, V1; Chaum D., 1981, COMMUN ACM, V24, P84; Chaum D., 1985, COMMUN ACM, V28, P1030; Chung L., 1993, CAISE93 P, P234; *EU INF SOC DG, 2001, IST PROGRAMME 2000 2; Fischer-Hubner S., 2001, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V1958; Gritzalis S., 2004, Information Management & Computer Security, V12, DOI 10.1108/09685220410542615; HE Q, 2003, INT WORKSH REQ ENG S, P115; Hong J.I., 2004, PRIVACY RISK MODELS; JENSEN C, 2005, STRAP STRUCTURED ANA; Kalloniatis C, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3183, P66; Kavakli E., 2004, P 2004 ACM S APPL CO, P1339, DOI 10.1145/967900.968171; LIU L, 2002, SREIS 02 E P RAL NC; LOUCOPOULOS P, 1999, LNCS, V1565; LOUCOPOULOS P, 2000, INFORM SYSTEMS ENG S; MOFFETT JD, 2003, 368 YCS U YORK DEP C; Mouratidis H, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2681, P63; Pfitzmann A., 1990, INFORM FACHBERICHTE, V234; Pfitzmann A., 1987, Computers & Security, V6, DOI 10.1016/0167-4048(87)90087-3; PFITZMANN B, 1990, DATENSCHUTZ DATENS 2, P305; PFITZMANN B, 1990, DATENSCHUTZ DATENS 1, P243; Reed MG, 1998, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V16, P482, DOI 10.1109/49.668972; Reiter M., 1998, ACM T INFORM SYST, V1, P66, DOI DOI 10.1145/290163.290168; Shields C., 2000, P 7 ACM C COMP COMM, P33, DOI 10.1145/352600.352607; Warren Samuel D., 1890, HARVARD LAW REV, V4, P193, DOI DOI 10.2307/1321160; Westin Alan, 1967, PRIVACY FREEDOM",38,6,7,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BRADFORD,"60/62 TOLLER LANE, BRADFORD BD8 9BY, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1066-2243,,,INTERNET RES,Internet Res.,,2006,16,2,,,,,140,158,,10.1108/10662240610656483,,19,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Business & Economics; Computer Science; Telecommunications,043DC,WOS:000237578500003,J,"Mesjasz, C",,,,"Mesjasz, C",,,Complex systems studies and the concepts of security,KYBERNETES,,,English,Article,,,,,,systems theory; social systems; metaphors; complexity theory; stability (control theory),,"Purpose - To present which properties of social systems can be used in studying and determining their broadly defined security. A core concept of security is to be developed into a typology of attributes of security of social systems. Design/methodology/approach - The interpretation of security has become one of the most important challenges of theory of international relations and of related areas. Unfortunately, theory only follows the processes and provides descriptions and interpretations. Explanations are rare or superficial. Predictions or normative approaches, essential for security considerations, are mainly embedded either in ideological discourse or in common sense conclusions. A broadly defined systems thinking is applied as an instrument allowing for enhancement of methodology of security research in dealing with complex social phenomena. Findings - It may not be expected that systems thinking could provide all the answers to the questions arising in security theory and policy. At the same time, it can be shown how strongly the discourse on a broadly defined security, not only in international relations, has been influenced by systems thinking. Research limitations/implications - It is but an introductory survey study and includes omissions and simplifications that have to be explained in detail in further studies. Practical implications - An introduction to the further research on the links between systems thinking and discourse on broadly defined security of individuals and social systems. Originality/value - Allows systems specialists to avoid simplifications in understanding social systems and at the same time helps security specialists to avoid abuses and trivialization of systems thinking.","Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland","Mesjasz, C (reprint author), Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",mesjaszc@ae.krakow.pl,,,,,"ALBERTS DS, 1999, COMPLEXITY GLOBAL PO; Anderson P.

Thus, context is synonymous for the content of a problem in a frame of the goals, starting points and ways to achieve these aims. In this light, difficulties of model validation and a general method how to overcome them was discussed. The relations among subject object - model in the light of a systems approach; Charles Sanders Peirce's triad principle and the semiotic principle of communication was presented. Design/methodology/approach - The appropriateness of a system dynamics methodology, which is due to its transparency and clarity an excellent tool for modelling of complex systems. Findings - In the paper the equivalence of different methodologies was shown, whose differences and similarities can be judged only in context of a problem and the aims of researches. For illustration, the methodology is applied to a tourism system, which possesses the typical properties of global and local organisations. A verbal description of a tourism problem is followed by a causal loop diagram, which helps to discuss the problem categorically. Practical implications - As the methodology is implemented using quantitative model and POWERSIM tools; it offers the solution of national tourism strategy implication, selected from different scenarios. Originality/value - This paper presents a simulation model of the tourism in a frame of system dynamics, developed from qualitative models, as an illustration of the discussed methodology.","Univ Primorska, TURISTICA Coll Tourism Studies, Portorose, Slovenia; Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kranj, Slovenia","Lazanski, TJ (reprint author), Univ Primorska, TURISTICA Coll Tourism Studies, Portorose, Slovenia.",tadeja.lazanski@turistica.edu; miroljub.kljajic@fov.uni-mb.si,,,,,"Beer S., 1959, CYBERNETICS MANAGEME; BERTALANFFY LV, 1952, GEN SYSTEM THEORY; Carnap R., 1952, OUTLINE THEORY SEMAN; FORRESTER JW, 1994, SYST DYNAM REV, V10, P245, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260100211; GROSSLER A, 2003, 2003 SYST DYN C NEW; Kljajic M, 2001, AIP CONF PROC, V573, P400; KLJAJIC M, 1994, THEORY SYSTEMS; LAZANSKI TJ, 2003, KVALITATIVNO MODELIR; MATURANA RH, 1998, TREE KNOWLEDGE; Miller J.G., 1978, LIVING SYSTEMS; MULEJ M, 1992, THEORIES SYSTEMS; PEIRCE CS, 1931, ESSENTIAL PEIRCE SEL; POPPER K, 1973, LOGIC SCI DISCOVERY; RILEY W, 2001, STATE QUALITATIVE TO, V27, P164; Rosen R, 1985, ANTICIPATORY SYSTEMS; Rosenhead J., 1989, RATIONAL ANAL PROBLE; Senge P.

We have characterized the response of the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 to (60)Co ionizing gamma radiation in an effort to understand the correlation between genetic information processing and physiological change. The physiological response model we have constructed is based on integrated analysis of temporal changes in global mRNA and protein abundance along with protein-DNA interactions and evolutionarily conserved functional associations. This systems view reveals cooperation among several cellular processes including DNA repair, increased protein turnover, apparent shifts in metabolism to favor nucleotide biosynthesis and an overall effort to repair oxidative damage. Further, we demonstrate the importance of time dimension while correlating mRNA and protein levels and suggest that steady-state comparisons may be misleading while assessing dynamics of genetic information processing across transcription and translation.","Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Baliga, NS (reprint author), Inst Syst Biol, 1441 N 34th St, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",nbaliga@systemsbiology.org,,,,,"Gygi SP, 1999, MOL CELL BIOL, V19, P1720; Imlay JA, 2003, ANNU REV MICROBIOL, V57, P395, DOI 10.1146/annurev.micro.57.030502.090938; Allers T, 2003, BIOCHEM SOC T, V31, P706, DOI 10.1042/BST0310706; Robertson CE, 2005, CURR OPIN MICROBIOL, V8, P638, DOI 10.1016/j.mib.2005.10.003; Kaur A, 2006, GENOME RES, V16, P841, DOI 10.1101/gr.5189606; WOESE CR, 1990, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V87, P4576, DOI 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576; Ideker T, 2001, SCIENCE, V292, P929, DOI 10.1126/science.292.5518.929; Reuter CJ, 2004, APPL ENVIRON MICROB, V70, P7530, DOI 10.1128/AEM.70.12.7530-7538.2004; Sancar A, 2004, ANNU REV BIOCHEM, V73, P39, DOI 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073723; Ghosal D, 2005, FEMS MICROBIOL REV, V29, P361, DOI 10.1016/j.femsre.2004.12.007; Baliga NS, 2000, MOL MICROBIOL, V36, P1184, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01916.x; Kottemann M, 2005, EXTREMOPHILES, V9, P219, DOI 10.1007/s00792-005-0437-4; Baliga NS, 2004, GENOME RES, V14, P1025, DOI 10.1101/gr.1993504; Ideker T, 2000, J COMPUT BIOL, V7, P805, DOI 10.1089/10665270050514945; Geiduschek EP, 2005, MOL MICROBIOL, V56, P1397, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2985.2005.04627.x; Liu YQ, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P4191, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0630387100; Rieger KE, 2004, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V32, P4786, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkh783; GOLDEN MHN, 1987, P NUTR SOC, V46, P53, DOI 10.1079/PNS19870008; CARBONNEAU MA, 1989, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V275, P244, DOI 10.1016/0003-9861(89)90370-6; Baliga NS, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P14913, DOI 10.1073/pnas.192558999; Cannio R., 2000, FRONT BIOSCI, V5, P768; Dianov GL, 2001, BIOESSAYS, V23, P745, DOI 10.1002/bies.1104; HUTCHINSON F, 1985, PROG NUCLEIC ACID RE, V32, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0079-6603(08)60347-5; Komori Kayoko, 2000, Journal of Biological Chemistry, V275, P33782, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M004557200; RILEY PA, 1994, INT J RADIAT BIOL, V65, P27, DOI 10.1080/09553009414550041; Sivaraman K, 2005, THEOR BIOL MED MODEL, V2, DOI 10.1186/1742-4682-2-20",26,38,41,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1744-4292,,,MOL SYST BIOL,Mol.

The nonlinear dynamics of infection transmission cause these patterns to make big differences in population infection levels. A science of infection transmission system analysis is needed to focus on those details that affect the control of infection transmission. This science must have a strong theoretical base because there is little chance that a dominantly data based approach not using mechanistic models of transmission will have any predictive value. The theoretical base should be built on linked transmission system models that are focused on making needed inferences for both building the theoretical base and making infection control decisions. The linking of different models is needed for a strategy of inference robustness assessment that is designed to find the model that is simple enough to effectively analyze the transmission system but not so simple that realistic violation of simplifying assumptions will change an inference. Types of models that should be used in such linked analyses include deterministic and stochastic compartmental models, discrete individual models with individual event histories but structured mass action mixing, network models that provide more detail as to who has contact with whom, and intermediate model forms such as correlation models that address some aspects of contact details while preserving the flexibility of deterministic compartmental models to structure mixing and analyze the system. While transmission system science is currently weak in regards both to its data base and its theory base, many things are now coming together that could make this science flourish. On the data side these include greater ability to detect infectious agent sequences in the environment and greater ability to sequence and genetically relate agents identified at different sites in the transmission system. On the theory sides, new model construction and model analysis methods are providing new potential to use the new sources of data. Also new parameter estimation methods provide new potential to combine models and data in effective analytic strategies.","Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Koopman, JS (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jkoopman@umich.edu,,,,,"Anderson R., 1991, INFECT DIS HUMANS DY; Koopman JS, 2001, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V954, P268; McCallum H, 2001, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V16, P295, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02144-9; Koopman J, 2004, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V25, P303, DOI 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.102802.124353; Keeling MJ, 1997, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V264, P1149; Grenfell B, 1997, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V12, P395, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01174-9; Diekmann O, 2000, MATH EPIDEMIOLOGY IN; JACQUEZ JA, 1989, MATH STAT APPROACHES, V83, P316; KOOPMAN JS, 2005, ECOLOGICAL PARDIGMS; O'Neill PD, 2002, MATH BIOSCI, V180, P103, DOI 10.1016/S0025-5564(02)00109-8; Riggs TW, 2004, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V132, P927, DOI 10.1017/S0950268804002560; Suzuki K, 2005, JPN J INFECT DIS, V58, pS1",12,12,14,0,2,NATL INST INFECTIOUS DISEASES,TOKYO,"JPN J INFECT DIS ED OFF NATL INST INFECTIOUS DISEASES TOYAMA 1-23-1, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 162-8640, JAPAN",1344-6304,1884-2836,,JPN J INFECT DIS,Jpn.

Data Sources: Peer-reviewed articles, books, and other publications on the topic of asthma care, dating back to 1931, were retrieved using MEDLINE searches and other external sources. Searches were restricted to include only studies with human subjects and the English language as descriptors, and the terms used included the following: system dynamics, statistical process control. charts, continual improvement, mental models, personal mastery, systems thinking, team learning, and shared vision. Personal author observations and experiences were also included. Study Selection: Review and original research studies that reported on these concepts were evaluated. Results: Results show that the concepts behind these models may be transferred to the system of asthma care. Indeed, case studies have shown that control charts can be used to detect signals of improved or declined function in asymptomatic patients, monitor medication adverse effects and the effects of adding a new medication, and evaluate the effectiveness of different medication delivery systems. Conclusions: These concepts and tools can provide immeasurable value to the process of rethinking and redesigning asthma care. They have the potential to help physicians and patients alike in designing and executing systems of care that are capable of not only delivering better outcomes but also inviting commitment to the long-term care many require.","Asthma Allergy Clin, Ctr Excellence, Shreveport, LA 71104 USA","Boggs, PB (reprint author), Asthma Allergy Clin, Ctr Excellence, 85 Olive St,Suite B, Shreveport, LA 71104 USA.",pboggs@ta2kg.org,,,,,"Martonen T, 2003, ADV DRUG DELIVER REV, V55, P829, DOI 10.1016/S0169-409X(03)00080-2; [Anonymous], 1994, OUT CRISIS; AT&T, 1956, STAT QUAL CONTR HDB; Berwick DM, 1990, CURING HLTH CARE; BOGGS P, 1998, NEW MED, V2, P307; Boggs PB, 1996, ANN ALLERG ASTHMA IM, V77, P429; Boggs P B, 1999, Jt Comm J Qual Improv, V25, P163; *CDCP NAT CTR HLTH, 2002, ASTHM PREV HLTH CAR; Fritz R., 1999, PATH LEAST RESISTANC; Institute of Medicine, 2001, CROSS QUAL CHASM NEW; Juran J.

Current policies, technologies, infrastructure, incentives and modes of thinking about the problem fail to consider the system-wide implications, and thus fail to foster the creation of new and innovative solutions. At the farm level, complexity, uncertainty and lack of compatibility with the current farming system need to be addressed in order to promote better manure management. Production facilities, feed management and waste treatment systems (including centralized treatment plants) need to be designed to allow for beneficial use of manure components. At the industry level, changes in the poultry, swine and beef industries have resulted in concentration, both in terms of decision-making and geography. This currently limits the ability of these farmers to take a systems approach to livestock production. Environmental policies thus need to take account and advantage of this new reality. At the economy-wide level, factors affecting the demand and supply for alternative manure products need to be considered. A number of innovative uses are being developed in the private sector, but there are constraints as far as technology, institutions and infrastructure are concerned. A systems perspective will allow the design of policies and technologies that reduce environmental problems associated with manure, while promoting efficient utilization of the resource.","Univ Missouri, Dept Agr Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","McCann, L (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Agr Econ, 214B Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",McCannL@missouri.edu,,,,,"ALEXANDER R, 2003, ANN M US COMP COUNC; Abdalla CW, 1995, AM J AGR ECON, V77, P1229, DOI 10.2307/1243353; Grusenmeyer DC, 1997, J DAIRY SCI, V80, P2651; LANYON LE, 1994, J DAIRY SCI, V77, P1999; PORTER ME, 1995, J ECON PERSPECT, V9, P97; Hinrichs CC, 2003, AGR HUM VALUES, V20, P125, DOI 10.1023/A:1024061425531; Applegate T., 2001, MANIPULATION ANIMAL; Aronson Daniel, 1996, INTRO SYSTEMS THINKI; BARDACH JE, 1979, FOOD NUTR B, V1; Brown RC, 2003, BIORENEWABLE RESOURC; COMUS D, 2000, GROWING CROP ALGAE D; Covey SR, 1989, 7 HABITS HIGHLY EFFE; DODD A, 2003, NEW EPA CAFO RULES P; FIBROMINN LLC, MAKEFIELD EXECUTIVE; GOODWIN HL, 1999, OFF FARM LITTER MANA; HANNAWALD JE, 1999, ALTERNATIVE WASTE MA, P10; Hoag D.

To describe the disease status of degenerative diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease) as function of disease process and treatment effects, a family of disease progression models is introduced. Methods. Disease progression is described using a progression rate (R-dp) acting on the synthesis or elimination parameters of the indirect response model. Symptomatic effects act as disease-dependent or -independent effects on the synthesis or elimination parameters. Protective drug effects act as disease dependent or -independent effects on R-dp. Results. Simulations with the ten disease models show distinctly different signature profiles of treatment effects on disease status. Symptomatic effects result in improvement of disease status with a subsequent deterioration. Treatment cessation results in a disease status equal to the situation where treatment had not been applied. Protective effects result in a lasting reduction, or even reversal, of the disease progression rate and the resulting disease status during the treatment period. After cessation of treatment the natural disease course will continue from the disease status at that point. Conclusion. Disease system analysis constitutes a scientific basis for the distinction between symptomatic versus protective drug effects in relation to specific disease processes as well as the identification of the exposure-response relationship during the time-course of disease.","Leiden Experts Adv Pharmacokinet & Pharmacodynam, Leiden, Netherlands; Leiden Univ, Div Pharmacol, Leiden Amsterdam Ctr Drug Res, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Danhof, M (reprint author), Leiden Experts Adv Pharmacokinet & Pharmacodynam, Leiden, Netherlands.",m.danhof@lacdr.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,"Mager DE, 2003, DRUG METAB DISPOS, V31, P510, DOI 10.1124/dmd.31.5.510; Atkinson AJ, 2001, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V69, P89, DOI 10.1067/mcp.2000.113989; Nissen SE, 2004, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V291, P1071, DOI 10.1001/jama.291.9.1071; Colburn WA, 2003, CLIN PHARMACOKINET, V42, P997, DOI 10.2165/00003088-200342120-00001; DAYNEKA NL, 1993, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V21, P457, DOI 10.1007/BF01061691; HOLFORD NHG, 1992, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V89, P11466, DOI 10.1073/pnas.89.23.11466; Olanow CW, 2004, ANNU REV MED, V55, P41, DOI 10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.104422; Haagsma CJ, 1997, BRIT J RHEUMATOL, V36, P1082; Richette P, 2004, JOINT BONE SPINE, V71, P18, DOI 10.1016/S1297-319X(03)00129-5; Schapira A, 2004, LANCET NEUROL, V3, P362, DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(04)00769-0; Zuideveld KP, 2002, EUR J PHARMACOL, V445, P43, DOI 10.1016/S0014-2999(02)01665-5; Breedveld FC, 2004, ANN RHEUM DIS, V63, P149, DOI 10.1136/ard.2003.013961; Lesko LJ, 2001, ANNU REV PHARMACOL, V41, P347, DOI 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.347; Sharma A, 1996, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V24, P611, DOI 10.1007/BF02353483; Sharma A, 1998, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V45, P229, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2125.1998.00676.x; VanderGraaf PH, 1997, INT J CLIN PHARM TH, V35, P442; Clarke CE, 2002, LANCET, V360, P1767, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11668-0; Zuideveld KP, 2002, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V303, P1130, DOI 10.1124/jpet.102.036798; Chan PLS, 2001, ANNU REV PHARMACOL, V41, P625, DOI 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.625; Colburn WA, 2003, J CLIN PHARMACOL, V43, P329, DOI 10.1177/0091270003252480; Pillai G, 2004, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V58, P618, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02224.x; Sheiner LB, 1997, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V61, P275, DOI 10.1016/S0009-9236(97)90160-0; JUSKO WJ, 1994, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V56, P406; Ilyin SE, 2004, TRENDS BIOTECHNOL, V22, P411, DOI 10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.005; Visser SAG, 2002, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V302, P1158, DOI 10.1124/jpet.302.3.1158; Lesko LJ, 2000, PHARMACEUT RES, V17, P1335, DOI 10.1023/A:1007574217260; Abadie E, 2004, OSTEOARTHR CARTILAGE, V12, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.joca.2004.01.006; CAMPBELL DB, 1991, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V14, pS21, DOI 10.1016/0168-8227(91)90005-X; Crnkic M, 2003, ARTHRITIS RES THER, V5, pR181, DOI 10.1186/ar760; DEJONGH J, 2002, MEASUREMENT KINETICS; DEWINTER W, 12 POP APPR GROUP C; DEWINTER W, 13 POP APPR GROUP C; Frey N, 2003, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V55, P147, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.01751.x; Gabrielsson J, 2000, PHARMACOKINETIC PHAR; HOLFORD NH, 13 POP APPR GROUP C; HOLFORD NHG, 2002, MEASUREMENT KINETICS; HOLFORD NHG, 1992, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V89, P11471, DOI 10.1073/pnas.89.23.11471; HOLFORD NHG, 1994, EUR J CLIN PHARMACOL, V47, P17; Jenner P, 2003, CURR OPIN NEUROL, V16, pS3, DOI 10.1097/00019052-200312001-00002; Jenner P, 2002, NEUROLOGY, V58, pS1; Johnston Tom H, 2004, Curr Opin Investig Drugs, V5, P720; Jonsson EN, 2002, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V72, P603, DOI 10.1067/mcp.2002.129307; Koller William C, 2004, Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep, V4, P277, DOI 10.1007/s11910-004-0052-2; Sander O, 1999, ANN RHEUM DIS, V58, P281, DOI 10.1136/ard.58.5.281; SHEINER LB, 1995, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V57, P6, DOI 10.1016/0009-9236(95)90260-0; Sheiner LB, 2002, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V54, P203, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2002.01628.x; Stoessl AJ, 2003, J NEURAL TRANSM-SUPP, P157; Van der Graaf PH, 1999, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V290, P702; VanderGraaf PH, 1997, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V283, P809; Visser SAG, 2003, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V307, P765, DOI 10.1124/jpet.103.054510; Zuideveld KP, 2002, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V300, P330, DOI 10.1124/jpet.300.1.330; Zuideveld KP, 2001, AM J PHYSIOL-REG I, V281, pR2059",52,46,50,3,6,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0724-8741,,,PHARM RES,Pharm.

The main purpose of this study is to develop a novel strategy planning theory and system to assist responsible authorities in obtaining alternatives of sustainable top river basin land use management. The concepts and theory of system analysis, driving force-state-response (DSR) framework, and system dynamics are used to establish the DSR dynamic strategy planning procedure in this work. The integrated management of the land, water, and air resources of a river basin system is considered in the procedure. Two modified land use management procedures combined with the DSR dynamic strategy planning procedure are developed in this work. Based on the DSR dynamic strategy planning procedure, the sustainable river basin land use management DSR dynamic decision support system (SRBLUM-DSRD-DSS) is developed by using the Vensim, MS Excel, ArcView, and Visual Basic software. The concepts of object-orientation are used to develop the system dynamic optimization and simulation models of SRBLUMDSRD-DSS. Based on the modified land use management procedures, SRBLUM-DSRD-DSS is used to assist decision makers in generating the land use plans of the Nankan river basin in Taoyuan County of Taiwan. Since the decisions of land, water and air resources management are still made at different agencies, the land use management system should be modified based on the innovational procedure to implement the management strategy developed in this work. The results show that the modified land use management procedures can be a guidance for the governments in modifying the systems and regulation of urban and regional plans in Taiwan. 0 2004","Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, Jungli 320, Taiwan; Taoyuan Cty Govt, Taoyuan 330, Taiwan","Chen, CH (reprint author), Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 414,Sec 3,Chung Shang E Rd, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",chchen@nanya.edu.tw; james.chc@msa.hinet.net,,,,,"Buller H, 1996, LAND USE POLICY, V13, P289, DOI 10.1016/0264-8377(96)84558-3; Chen CH, 2000, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V42, P389; Chen ChingHo, 1997, Proceedings of the National Science Council, Republic of China.

Getting agreement among multiple stakeholders requires the exercise of moral imagination, which involves: Perceiving one's own mental model of a system, both as it exists (descriptive) and as one would like it to be (normative). Comparing different mental models across expertises and stakeholder interests. Generating and evaluating alternatives that would facilitate a transition from descriptive to normative scenarios. This framework is applied to genetically-modified organisms and to the development of an environmentally-intelligent textile. The article concludes with a discussion of Earth Systems Engineering Management (ESEM), which represents a novel, interdisciplinary approach to working with complex, integrated human/natural systems. Increasingly, such systems involve close coupling among environmental, social and technological elements. Such systems are not entirely predictable. ESEM calls for: Systems thinking that sees the interaction between parts of system and avoids problems like optimizing one part of a system at the expense of the whole. The use of reversible technologies that can be reconfigured based on results from: Close monitoring of systems interactions-including dialogue with multiple experts and stakeholders. To succeed, ESEM will have to offer more than a framework for thinking about complex human/natural systems-it will have to adapt or evolve a set of tools that facilitate collaborative monitoring and management. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.","Univ Virginia, Dept Sci Technol & Soc, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Gorman, ME (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Sci Technol & Soc, POB 400744,Thornton Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",meg3c@virginia.edu,,,,,"Allenby B, 2000, IEEE TECHNOL SOC MAG, V19, P10, DOI 10.1109/44.890078; Alvarez W., 1997, T REX CRATER DOOM; Collins HM, 2002, SOC STUD SCI, V32, P235, DOI 10.1177/0306312702032002003; Wu JG, 2002, ECOL MODEL, V153, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3800(01)00498-7; Vitousek PM, 1997, SCIENCE, V277, P494, DOI 10.1126/science.277.5325.494; SEN A, 1994, NEW YORK REV BOOKS, V41, P62; STAR SL, 1989, SOC STUD SCI, V19, P387, DOI 10.1177/030631289019003001; Sklar FH, 2001, ECOL ECON, V37, P379, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(01)00180-X; Grimm NB, 2000, BIOSCIENCE, V50, P571, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0571:IATLTO]2.0.CO;2; Colvin VL, 2003, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V21, P1166, DOI 10.1038/nbt875; Baird D., 1999, PERSPECTIVES SCI, V7, P231, DOI 10.1162/posc.1999.7.2.231; Bijker WE, 1995, BICYCLES BAKELITES B; Douglas M.

The mechanism of this transition is unknown. A systems approach to disease begins with the quantitative delineation of the informational elements (mRNAs and proteins) in various disease states. We employed two recently developed high-throughput technologies, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and isotope-coded affinity tag, to gain a comprehensive picture of the changes in mRNA levels and more restricted analysis of protein levels, respectively, during the transition from androgen-dependent LNCaP (model for early-stage prostate cancer) to androgen-independent CL1 cells (model for late-stage prostate cancer). We sequenced > 5 million MPSS signatures, obtained > 142,000 tandem mass spectra, and built comprehensive MPSS and proteomic databases. The integrated mRNA and protein expression data revealed underlying functional differences between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The high sensitivity of MPSS enabled us to identify virtually all of the expressed transcripts and to quantify the changes in gene expression between these two cell states, including functionally important low-abundance mRNAs, such as those encoding transcription factors and signal transduction molecules. These data enable us to map the differences onto extant physiologic networks, creating perturbation networks that reflect prostate cancer progression. We found 37 BioCarta and 14. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways that are up-regulated and 23 BioCarta and 22 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways that are down-regulated in LNCaP cells versus CL1 cells.

While this strategy certainly shows promise, it cannot provide a model readily applicable to the computational simulation of the genetic network when the given time-series data contain measurement noise. This is a significant limitation of the problem decomposition, given that our analysis and understanding of the genetic network depend on the computational simulation. Results: We propose a new method for inferring S-system models of large-scale genetic networks. The proposed method is based on the problem decomposition strategy and a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. As the subproblems divided by the problem decomposition strategy are solved simultaneously using the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm, the proposed method can be used to infer any S-system model ready for computational simulation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to two artificial genetic network inference problems. Finally, the proposed method is used to analyze the actual DNA microarray data.","RIKEN, Genom Sci Ctr, Bioinformat Grp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; RIKEN, Genom Sci Ctr, Prot Res Grp, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; RIKEN, Harima Inst Spring 8, Cellular Signaling Lab, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; RIKEN, Harima Inst Spring 8, Structurome Grp, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; IBM Japan Ltd, Tokyo Res Lab, Kanagawa 2428502, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Osaka Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Sch Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan","Kimura, S (reprint author), RIKEN, Genom Sci Ctr, Bioinformat Grp, 1-7-22 Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",skimura@gsc.riken.jp,"Konagaya, Akihiko/F-9302-2014",,,,"Potter MA, 2000, EVOL COMPUT, V8, P1, DOI 10.1162/106365600568086; Sakamoto E, 2001, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT, P720, DOI 10.1109/CEC.2001.934462; D'haeseleer P, 2000, BIOINFORMATICS, V16, P707, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.707; Liu Y, 2001, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT, P1101, DOI 10.1109/CEC.2001.934314; Voit EO, 2004, BIOINFORMATICS, V20, P1670, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth140; Kwon AT, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P905, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg106; Akutsu T, 2000, BIOINFORMATICS, V16, P727, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.727; Vance W, 2002, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V99, P5816, DOI 10.1073/pnas.02204969; Eisen MB, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P14863, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.25.14863; Kikuchi S, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P643, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg027; Thieffry D, 1998, BIOESSAYS, V20, P433, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199805)20:5<433::AID-BIES10>3.0.CO;2-2; Chen T., 1999, P PAC S BIOC, V4, P29; CLEVELAND WS, 1979, J AM STAT ASSOC, V74, P829, DOI 10.2307/2286407; HOLLAND JH, 1975, ADAPTATION NATURAL A; Kano M, 2003, PRESENCE-TELEOP VIRT, V12, P96, DOI 10.1162/105474603763835369; Kimura S., 2004, CHEMBIO INFORMATICS, V4, P1, DOI 10.1273/cbij.4.1; KIMURA S, 2003, P 2003 C EV COMP CEC, P631; Kimura S., 2003, P 2003 INT C SYST MA, P335; Maki Y, 2001, P PAC S BIOC, V6, P446; Maki Y., 2002, GENOME INFORMATICS, V13, P382; Morishita R., 2003, P 2003 C EV COMP CEC, P615; Press W.

Quality of life measures tend to treat quality of life as a stable construct that can be measured externally. They do not consider people's differing expectations and assume that what quality of life means to people is stable over time. This paper reports on a study which aimed to find out how measures of oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) vary between and change within individuals. Longitudinal semi-structured open-ended interviews were carried out with twenty people with socially noticeable broken, decayed or missing teeth who were or were not seeking dental treatment. The data were collected and analysed using the iterative processes of grounded systems theory based on Glaserian (Theoretical Sensitivity, The Sociology Press, Mill Valley, CA, 1978) grounded theory and Luhmann's (Social Systems, Stanford University, Stanford, 1984) social systems theory. During the data analysis it emerged that participants' were adopting positions on seven dimensions of oral health relating to the positions that people would adopt with respect norm, attribution, trust, accessibility, commodity, authenticity, and character. The core distinction that accommodated people's varying positions was that people constructed their own margins of relevance of oral health. The margins of relevance indicated a variable from a hypothetical extreme of 'super-relevant' to the other extreme of 'not relevant'. The margins of relevance could shift, meaning that assessments of quality of life would vary. Oral health related quality of life is therefore defined as the cyclical and self-renewing interaction between the relevance and impact of oral health in everyday life. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also a key element in the management of cropping systems by farmers. Therefore, cropping system design entails the understanding and evaluation of farmers' fertilisation practices. Biophysical models describing the soil-plant system can serve this purpose. A comparison between model outputs and farmers' practices was made of a set of 128 apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) plots from 31 members of a farmers' co-operative in south-eastern, France. Farmers' fertilisation practices were compared with theoretical practices generated by a series of soil-plant system models of increasing complexity, each model giving the amount of nitrogen that should be applied to the plot according to the knowledge, included in the model. The model that reproduced farmers' fertilisation practices most closely was the most complex, taking all plant requirements, soil organic matter and residue mineralisation, denitrification and irrigation supply into account. A Monte Carlo method showed that the differences between farmers' practices and model outputs were not random. Spatial analysis showed a strong spatial organisation of these differences, mainly due to three farms. This congruence between farmers' practices and model outputs suggests the existence of some indicators that depict the N nutrition status of the orchard as a basis for rules indicating how much nitrogen should be applied. The spatial analysis suggests the existence of farmer and neighbourhood effects, which need to be explained. Models appear to be useful tools to study farmers' practices by removing biophysical effects (soil, variety, etc.).. This raises new questions concerning agricultural research at the interface between the biophysical and social sciences. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as ""what-if"" tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions - for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak - some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tic empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.

It is the combination of electronic and mobile commerce performed over mobile terminals such as mobile phones, laptops, portable digital assistants (PDA), etc. Typical services include mobile banking, mobile shopping, mobile stock trading, mobile auction etc. It is widely regarded as an important innovation in creating more business opportunities and has a brighter future than its precedent - electronic commerce. With the development of mobile commerce, a new market of mobile commerce and its derivatives, such as mobile commerce terminal market, mobile network market, mobile equipment market, and mobile software market, comes into existence. However, since mobile commerce is still in its beginning there is a lot of uncertainty in its future. This uncertainty causes the emerging mobile commerce market to be in a dynamic and complicated state. How to develop a reliable model to explore this new market and examine the behavior of the market development is becoming increasingly important. This paper provides a framework which is practical in building confidence, namely the System Dynamics (SD) modeling of a mobile commerce market. System Dynamics modeling is a rigorous method for studying and managing complex systems. This framework is designed to enhance the model's reliability by combining some group process techniques, like workshops, group discussions, brainstorming, Delphi surveys, and fieldwork, with System Dynamics modeling. The mobile commerce market in this paper is regarded as a social economic system. The model-building process makes full use of group techniques so that the model can reasonably incorporate a wide variety of sources of knowledge including: system thinking, system dynamics, management science, mobile commerce, and marketing and hence the reliability is enhanced. The framework covers three stages of the model-building process: modeling, testing, and experimenting. In the modeling stage, the framework is aimed at developing a mental representation, identifying the Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) and the Stock Flow Diagram (SFD), with which a simulation model can be developed for the mobile commerce market. A CLD links variables that have causal interpretation and an SFD represents the structure of a target system with denotations of accumulation and flow rate. In this stage, mental representations are drawn in workshops attended by a group of researchers who elicit knowledge from experts by soliciting their judgments. Casual loop and stock flow diagrams are next developed and relationships between the variables are formalized using mathematical, logical and theoretical means and expert's opinion are solicited for justifying the models. In the testing stage, the aim is to test the robustness of the model developed. In addition to passing some common sense tests, the model has to pass several specific tests on some key parameters determined by the panel of researchers in order to examine the fitness of the model by comparing historical data with simulation results data. In the experimenting stage, the model is simulated to analyze the behavior of mobile commerce diffusion under different scenarios of national planning policies. As an illustration, a simulation model is empirically developed, calibrated and simulated for the Chinese market. In general, we found the framework to be useful for modeling mobile commerce diffusion in the Chinese mobile commerce market formation example.","[Wang, W.; Cheong, F.] RMIT Univ, Sch Business Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Wang, W (reprint author), RMIT Univ, Sch Business Informat Technol, Level 17,239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",wenqing.wang@rmit.edu.au,,,,,"Box G, 1979, ROBUSTNESS STRATEGY; Coyle RG, 1996, SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODE; Forrester J., 1961, INDUSTRIAL DYNAMICS; FORRESTER JW, 1992, EUR J OPER RES, V59, P42, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(92)90006-U; Forrester J.

Much of the development in Pittwater, NSW, local government area is on steep coastal land which has a history of slope instability. Concern over cases of poorly performing or failing on-site wastewater systems and the recognition that these and newly designed systems could be contributory to slope instability has been a factor in Pittwater Council, NSW, requiring that landslide risk assessment be undertaken for new and amended on-site wastewater management systems in potentially unstable areas. This paper describes the wastewater management system design and landslide risk assessment undertaken at Pittwater Youth Hostel in accordance with the Australian Geomechanics Society ' s Geotechnical Risk Management procedure to comply with the Pittwater Policy. The work completed illustrates both necessary and effective interaction of the wastewater and geotechnical professions to achieve a successful outcome for the client. It is likely that this professional interaction will be increasingly common along the NSW coast and elsewhere.","Univ Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; GHD LongMac, Artarmon, NSW 2064, Australia","Whitehead, JH (reprint author), Univ Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.",cpjhw@alinga.newcastle.edu.au; Andrew_Leventhal@ghd.com.au,,,,,"*AUSTR GEOM SOC, 2000, AUSTR GEOMECHANICS, V35, P1; *GHD LONGMAC, 2003, PITTW YHA HOST LANDS; *HORNSB SHIR COUNC, 2001, ENH OPT ONS SEW MAN; MARTENS DM, 1999, P ONS 99 C MAK ONS W, P255; *NSW DEP LOC GOV, 1998, ENV HLTH PROT GUID O; *PITTW COUNC, 2003, INT GEOT RISK MAN PO; *STAND AUSTR, 2000, 15472000 ASNZS; *WHIT ASS ENV CONS, 2003, SIT SOIL EV WAST MAN; *WHIT ASS ENV CONS, 2002, CONC DES DEC SEW MAN",9,0,0,4,5,I W A PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

Since the 19th century, a major scientific endeavour has been to associate structurally distinct cortical regions with specific cognitive functions. This was traditionally accomplished by correlating microstructurally defined areas with lesion sites found in patients with specific neuropsychological symptoms. Modern neuroimaging techniques with high spatial resolution have promised an alternative approach, enabling non-invasive measurements of regionally specific changes of brain activity that are correlated with certain components of a cognitive process. Reviewing classic approaches towards brain structure-function relationships that are based on correlational approaches, this article argues that these approaches are not sufficient to provide an understanding of the operational principles of a dynamic system such as the brain but must be complemented by models based on general system theory. These models reflect the connectional structure of the system under investigation and emphasize context-dependent couplings between the system elements in terms of effective connectivity. The usefulness of system models whose parameters are fitted to measured functional imaging data for testing hypotheses about structure-function relationships in the brain and their potential for clinical applications is demonstrated by several empirical examples.","UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England;

The first tenet of care is to do no harm. The enormous complexity of modern medical care has made error detection and management extremely difficult. Traditional deterministic methods of solving the ""error issue"" cannot cope with the huge number of potential errors that are possible. Systems thinking and approach to error reduction provides a different avenue for tackling this challenging dilemma. The intent of this article is to introduce a systems view of medical errors and to explain how it can provide new insights about dealing with massively complex organizations such as the healthcare system. Important features include an understanding of system relationships, sources of error, human components, optimization versus perfection in systems and the interrelationships between human and system processes.

These systems are continually evolving in response to changing climatic patterns, land use practices and the increasing intervention of humans. Management of these watersheds benefits from the development and application of models that offer a comprehensive and integrated view of these complex systems and the demands placed upon them. The utility of these models is greatly enhanced if they are developed in a participatory process that incorporates the views and knowledge of relevant stakeholders. System dynamics provides a unique mathematical framework for integrating the physical and social processes important to watershed management, and for providing an interactive interface for engaging the public. We have employed system dynamics modeling to assist in community-based water planning for a three-county region in north-central New Mexico. The planning region is centered on a similar to 165-km reach of the Rio Grande that includes the greater Albuquerque metropolitan area. The challenge, which is common to other arid/semi-arid environments, is to balance a highly variable water supply among the demands posed by urban development, irrigated agriculture, river/reservoir evaporation and riparian/ in-stream uses. A description of the model and the planning process are given along with results and perspectives drawn from both.","Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA","Tidwell, VC (reprint author), Sandia Natl Labs, POB 5800,MS 0735, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA.",vctidwe@sandia.gov,,,,,"Stave KA, 2003, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V67, P303, DOI 10.1016/S0301-4797(02)00205-0; MARTIN WE, 1986, WATER RESOUR RES, V22, P1735, DOI 10.1029/WR022i013p01735; Forrester JW, 1987, SYST DYNAM REV, V3, P136, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260030205; Simonovic SP, 1999, WATER RESOUR RES, V35, P295, DOI 10.1029/1998WR900023; *BBER, 2002, NEW MEXICO BUSINESS, V23, P8; Cartwright L, 2003, P 2003 UCOWR M WASH; *COA, 2003, WAT CONS PROGR WEBS; *COA, 2002, HYDR AFF PROP CIT AL; Crawford CS, 1996, NEW MEXICO J SCI, V36, P276; Engelman R., 2000, PEOPLE BALANCE POPUL; Ford A, 1996, SYST DYNAM REV, V12, P305, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1727(199624)12:4<305::AID-SDR110>3.0.CO;2-4; Forrester J.W., 1990, PRINCIPLES SYSTEMS; Glover RE, 1954, EOS T AGU, V35, P468; LOUKS DP, 1985, WATER RESOUR RES, V21, P95; McAda DP, 2002, 024200 US GEOL SURV; *MRGCD, 2001, EST IRR ACR JUL 2000; PALMER RN, 1993, C P WAT MAN 90S TIM; Passell HD, 2004, J AM WATER RESOUR AS, V40, P111, DOI 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01014.x; PASSELL HD, 2003, 20030636 SAND SAND N; Postel S., 1997, LAST OASIS FACING WA; Shuttleworth W.

The objective of this study was to evaluate siting practices and treatment efficacy of on-site septic systems within the Cannonsville Reservoir watershed (115 900 ha) in the state of New York. Using digital soil survey data, a database of on-site conditions was developed from more than 1100 existing septic system siting records. Soil map units were grouped into four classes based on their suitability to meet common septic system design criteria. A geographic information system was found to be a useful tool for assessment and visual display of septic system and landscape information. Geographic information system analysis indicated that while 80% of soils in the watershed were found to have characteristics that interfere with septic system function, 69% of septic systems installed were of designs suited for soils with no or few restrictive parameters. Since the designs of many septic systems have relied heavily on horizontal distance to streams (mean = 130 m) to provide adequate treatment, potential failures would lead to discharge of compounds of environmental concern, such as phosphorus, with public health implications. The results imply that many septic systems functioning in the watershed are in need of design improvements.","Delaware Cty Soil & Water Conservat Dist, Walton, NY 13856 USA","Day, L (reprint author), Delaware Cty Soil & Water Conservat Dist, 44 W St, Walton, NY 13856 USA.",larry-day@ny.nacdnet.org,,,,,"Cerosaletti PE, 2004, J DAIRY SCI, V87, P2314; Sims JT, 1998, J ENVIRON QUAL, V27, P277; Simard RR, 2000, J ENVIRON QUAL, V29, P97; Akhtar MS, 2003, SOIL SCI SOC AM J, V67, P458; Frankenberger JR, 1999, HYDROL PROCESS, V13, P805, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(19990430)13:6<805::AID-HYP754>3.0.CO;2-M; Auer Martin T., 1998, Lake and Reservoir Management, V14, P278; CALDWELL DH, 1986, SURFICIAL GEOLOGIC M; Canter L.W., 1985, SEPTIC TANK SYSTEM E; Effler S.

Here, a combinatorial library of fluorescent small molecules was used to visualize subcellular transport pathways in living cells, using a kinetic, high content imaging system to monitor spatiotemporal variations of intracellular probe distribution. Most probes accumulate in cytoplasmic vesicles and probe kinetics conform to a nested, two-compartment dynamical system. At steady state, probes preferentially partition from the extracellular medium to the cytosol, and from the cytosol to cytoplasmic vesicles, with hydrophobic molecules favoring sequestration. Altogether, these results point to a general organizing principle underlying the system dynamics of subcellular, small molecule transport. In addition to plasma membrane permeability, subcellular transport phenomena can determine the active concentration of small molecules in the cytosol and the efflux of small molecules from cells. Fundamentally, direct observation of intracellular probe distribution challenges the simple boundary model of classical pharmacokinetics, which considers cells as static permeability barriers.","[Chen, Vivien Y.; Rosania, Gus R.] Univ Michigan, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Khersonsky, Sonya M.; Chang, Young Tae] New York Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Shedden, Kerby] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Rosania, GR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 428 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",grosania@umich.edu,"Chang, Young-Tae/B-2780-2010","Chang, Young-Tae/0000-0002-1927-3688",Upjohn-Vahlteich; University of Michigan College of Pharmacy; University of Michigan Pharmacological Sciences Training Program; NIGMS [GM07767],"We thank P.

This study addresses this issue by providing a random dynamical system analysis of the Morris-Lecar neural model driven by a white Gaussian noise current. Depending on parameter selections, the deterministic Morris-Lecar model can be considered as a canonical prototype for widely encountered classes of neuronal membranes, referred to as class I and class II membranes. In both the transitions from excitable to oscillating regimes are associated with different bifurcation scenarios. This work examines how random perturbations affect these two bifurcation scenarios. It is first numerically shown that the Morris-Lecar model driven by white Gaussian noise current tends to have a unique stationary distribution in the phase space. Numerical evaluations also reveal quantitative and qualitative changes in this distribution in the vicinity of the bifurcations of the deterministic system. However, these changes notwithstanding, our numerical simulations show that the Lyapunov exponents of the system remain negative in these parameter regions, indicating that no dynamical stochastic bifurcations take place. Moreover, our numerical simulations confirm that, regardless of the asymptotic dynamics of the deterministic system, the random Morris-Lecar model stabilizes at a unique stationary stochastic process. In terms of random dynamical system theory, our analysis shows that additive noise destroys the above-mentioned bifurcation sequences that characterize class I and class II regimes in the Morris-Lecar model. The interpretation of this result in terms of neuronal coding is that, despite the differences in the deterministic dynamics of class I and class II membranes, their responses to noise-like stimuli present a reliable feature.

We apply a systems tool, the sensitivity model (SM), to build a model of the development of the community of Ping-Ding, located adjacent to the Yang-Ming-Shan National Park, Taiwan. The major issue in the development of Ping-Ding is the conflict between environmental conservation and the development of a local tourism industry. With the involvement of local residents, planners, and interest groups, a system model of 26 variables was defined to identify characteristics of Ping-Ding through pattern recognition. Two scenarios concerning the sustainable development of Ping-Ding are simulated with interlinked feedbacks from variables. The results of the analysis indicate that the development of Ping-Ding would be better served by the planning of agriculture and the tourism industry. The advantages and shortfalls of applying SM in the current planning environment of Taiwan are also discussed to conclude this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The assumptions on interaction between players are based on the Prisoner's Dilemma game that has been used extensively in game theory and in the study of biological systems. Each player is located on a square lattice, and is assumed to cooperate or defect, based on mimicking the neighbor with the highest cumulative score from the preceding round of play. The edges of the lattice are glued to form a torus. Computer simulations are conducted for different sized lattices, different payoff values, and different initial conditions. Though the paper is primarily concerned with player behaviour without self-interaction, some results with self-interaction are also included. The influence of ""ideal"" cooperators on the evolution of the system dynamics is also studied. Three generic regimes of behaviour are identified. Complex global patterns with complicated dynamics and sometimes unpredictable results occur. Steady-state solutions, simple and complex periodic solutions, and traveling waves are observed depending on the initial conditions and the payoff values.","Univ So Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wiederien, RJ (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Aerosp & Mech Engn, 430K Olin Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,,,,"Roberts G, 1998, NATURE, V394, P175, DOI 10.1038/28160; Milinski M, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P13755, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.23.13755; Wedekind C, 1996, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V93, P2686, DOI 10.1073/pnas.93.7.2686; FERRIERE R, 1995, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V259, P77, DOI 10.1098/rspb.1995.0012; Szabo G, 1998, PHYS REV E, V58, P69, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.58.69; HUTSON VCL, 1995, PHILOS T ROY SOC B, V348, P393, DOI 10.1098/rstb.1995.0077; NOWAK MA, 1994, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V91, P4877, DOI 10.1073/pnas.91.11.4877; NOWAK MA, 1992, NATURE, V359, P826, DOI 10.1038/359826a0; NOWAK MA, 1995, SCI AM, V272, P76; Key C, 2000, FOLIA PRIMATOL, V71, P77, DOI 10.1159/000021732; Axelrod R.

The paper highlights the key differences in approach, but then invites closer collaboration in the cause of the possible contribution that systems thinking could make for a longer term future, with Y3K( Year 3000) as a metaphor for this. This analysis, which derives from work undertaken at Asilomar 1995 and Fuschl conversations in 2000 and 2002, finds that contemporary social system design, which is driven by western culture and is action-oriented, needs adaptation before it could contribute to greater future global harmony. A truly comprehensive systems design process must accommodate a wide range of possible parameters in terms of culture, and appreciation of time and progress. An emerging paradigm as basis for thinking and engaging in social systems design work of the future is offered, which also has relevance to general systems practice.","Open Univ E England, Cambridge CB2 1PF, England","Dyer, G (reprint author), Open Univ E England, 12 Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 1PF, England.",g.c.dyer@open.ac.uk,,,,,"Ackoff RL, 2003, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V20, P287, DOI 10.1002/sres.544; BANATHY BH, 1989, SYST RES, V6, P289, DOI 10.1002/sres.3850060403; *AR OP U, WELC AR OP U; Banathy B.

Unlike the purpose - specific compartment approach, the methodical, conceptual and computational uniformity in modeling various linear biomedical systems is the dominant characteristic of the linear system approach technology. Saturation of the metabolic reaction results in nonlinear kinetics according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The two compartment open model with Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics is theorethicaly basic when single doses of drug are administered. To simulate data or to fit real data using this model, one must resort to numerical integration. A biomathematical model for multiple dosage regimen calculations of nonlinear metabolic systems in steady-state and a working example with phenytoin are presented. High correlation between phenytoin steady-state serum levels calculated from individual K-m and V-max values in the 15 adult epileptic outpatients and the observed levels at the third adjustment of phenytoin daily dose (r=0.961, p<0.01) were found.","Fac Med, Dept Pharmacol, Novi Sad, Serbia Monteneg, Yugoslavia","Popovic, J (reprint author), Fac Med, Dept Pharmacol, Hajduk Veljkova 3,FAH 380, Novi Sad, Serbia Monteneg, Yugoslavia.",,,,,,"Michaelis L, 1913, BIOCHEM Z, V49, P333; GIBALDI M, 1971, J PHARM SCI, V60, P1338, DOI 10.1002/jps.2600600909; ARMIJO JA, 1991, THER DRUG MONIT, V13, P507, DOI 10.1097/00007691-199111000-00007; BOTTS J, 1953, T FARADAY SOC, V49, P696, DOI 10.1039/tf9534900696; BRAY HG, 1951, BIOCHEM J, V48, P88; BRIGGS GE, 1925, BIOCHEM J, V19, P383; BURGER DM, 1994, THER DRUG MONIT, V16, P616, DOI 10.1097/00007691-199412000-00015; Cai W M, 1991, Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao, V12, P141; CHIBA K, 1980, J PEDIATR-US, V96, P479; Dedik L, 2002, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V69, P49, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2607(01)00188-2; Dedik L, 1999, SYSTEM APPROACH TECH; DEDIK L, 1995, INT J BIOMED COMPUT, V39, P231, DOI 10.1016/0020-7101(95)01101-J; Dedik L, 1996, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V51, P183, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2607(96)01770-1; Dedik L, 2002, METHOD FIND EXP CLIN, V24, P481, DOI 10.1358/mf.2002.24.8.705067; Dedik L, 2001, METHOD FIND EXP CLIN, V23, P213, DOI 10.1358/mf.2001.23.5.662114; DEDIK L, 1994, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V22, P293, DOI 10.1007/BF02353623; DURISOVA M, 1994, METHOD FIND EXP CLIN, V16, P219; Durisova M, 1997, PHARM RES-DORDR, V14, P860, DOI 10.1023/A:1012139530965; DURISOVA M, 1995, B MATH BIOL, V57, P787, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8240(95)80001-8; GLICK TH, 2004, J FARM PRACT, V532, P197; Henri V, 1901, CR HEBD ACAD SCI, V133, P891; KOREN G, 1984, THER DRUG MONIT, V6, P11; KRUGERTHIEMER E, 1968, NONLINEAR DOSE CONCE, V23, P717; KRUGERTHIEMER E, 1968, 3 INT PHARM M SAO PA, V7, P63; LUDDEN MT, 1976, LANCET, V7, P307; LUDDEN MT, 1980, PHARM PHARM, V32, P152; LUDDEN TM, 1977, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V21, P287; Martinelli EF, 2003, J CLIN PHARM THER, V28, P385, DOI 10.1046/j.0269-4727.2003.00506.x; MULLEN PW, 1978, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V23, P228; MULLEN WP, 1979, J PHARM PHARMACOL, V31, P100; POPOVIC J, 1987, ACTA PHARM JUGOSL, V37, P313; POPOVIC J, 1985, IUGOSLAV PHYSL PH S3, V21, P287; POPOVIC J, 1994, ARCH TOXICOL KINET X, V2, P417; Popovic J, 1999, EXP TOXICOL PATHOL, V51, P409; POPOVIC J, 1992, RECENT DEV THERAPEUT, P409; POPOVIC J, 1982, PERIOD BIOL, V84, P176; POPOVIC J, 1986, PERIOD BIOL, V88, P183; Purkins L, 2003, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V56, P37, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.01997.x; RICHENS A, 1975, LANCET, V2, P247; RODRIGUEZ AV, 1991, J CLIN PHARM THER, V16, P55, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2710.1991.tb00284.x; RUBIN GM, 1984, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V12, P437, DOI 10.1007/BF01062667; Schubert G, 2001, ISSUES STUD, V37, P128; SOLDIN SJ, 1976, CLIN CHEM, V22, P856; VAUGHAN PD, 1975, J PHARM PHARMACOL, V27, P458; VOZEH S, 1981, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V9, P131, DOI 10.1007/BF01068078; WAGNER JG, 1978, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V6, P209, DOI 10.1007/BF01312263; WALTER C, 1974, J BIOL CHEM, V249, P699; Wang XL, 2003, SEIZURE-EUR J EPILEP, V12, P330, DOI 10.1016/S1059-1311(03)00099-2",48,6,6,2,2,MEDECINE ET HYGIENE,GENEVA 4,"78, AVE DE LA ROSERAIE, CASE POSTALE 456,, CH-1211 GENEVA 4, SWITZERLAND",0378-7966,,,EUR J DRUG METAB PH,Eur.

However, usage of system dynamics remains low, which questions the true value that policy-makers gain from the approach as currently delivered. Feedback systems thinking and causal loop diagrams currently dominate the representation of problem situations. Although substantial benefits are claimed for this approach, it embeds serious theoretical and pedagogical flaws, notably by separating the problem behaviour from the structure alleged to cause it, by ignoring scale and timing of behaviour, and by excluding the fundamental and unavoidable properties of asset stock accumulation. Policy-makers are thus unlikely to be provided with actionable solutions, whether from feedback diagrams alone or from subsequent simulation models, a failure that may have irretrievably alienated a significant fraction of management who have been exposed to system dynamics.

Several methodologies can be discerned which have proved to possess extraordinary power in dealing with complex issues. System dynamics is a general-purpose methodology for modelling and simulation employed in order to deal with dynamic complexity. Cybernetics has brought forth structural models to enable organizations to deal with the complexity of their environments. The main proposition of this paper is that these two methodological strands show potential synergies. A proposal for leveraging the complementarities of system dynamics and organizational cybernetics is made. The paper also argues that it is necessary to conflate qualitative and quantitative modelling and design approaches, as well as to improve the quality of models and strategies by strengthening the processes of validation. At a higher level of abstraction, the author postulates that, for the sake of relevance, this methodological synthesis is to build upon both the positivist and interpretivist traditions. On this basis, a framework called integrative systems methodology is proposed to help actors at different levels to achieve the requisite variety.

Determination of the specific mechanisms underlying such behaviours isimportant, e.g. to determine sensitivity, robustness, and modelling requirements of given cell functions. In this work we adopt a systems approach to the analysis of complex behaviours in intracellular reaction networks, described byordinary differential equations with known kinetic parameters. We propose to decompose the overall system into a number of low complexity subsystems, and consider the importance of interactions between these in generating specific behaviours. Rather than analysing the network in a state corresponding to the complex non-linear behaviour, we move the system to the underlying unstable steady state, and focus on the mechanisms causing destabilisation of this steady state. This is motivated by the fact that all complex behaviours in unforced systems can be traced to destabilisation (bifurcation) of some steady state, andhence enables us to use tools from linear system theory to qualitatively analyse the sources of given network behaviours. One important objective of the present study is to see how far one can come with a relatively simple approach to the analysis of highly complex biochemical networks. The proposed method is demonstrated by application to a model of mitotic control in Xenopus frog eggs, and to a model of circadian oscillations in Drosophila. In both examples we are able to identify the subsystems, and the related interactions, which are instrumental in generating the observed complex non-linear behaviours.",,"Royal Inst Technol, S3 Automat Control, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,IEE-INST ELEC ENG,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1741-2471,,,SYSTEMS BIOL,Syst.

Mild shocks, which induced tail flipping in the crayfish, and light illumination were used as unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, respectively. In Experiment 1, two groups of crayfish were trained in a one-way shuttle box. The crayfish in Group Forward were placed in the start compartment facing the escape compartment and they were able to escape/avoid shocks by walking forward, while the crayfish in Group Backward were placed in the compartment facing the opposite direction and they were able to escape by tail flipping. Avoidance learning was achieved only by walking, and not by tail flipping despite the fact that consistent tail flipping allowed the crayfish to avoid shocks. In Experiment 2, the experimental conditions were switched by using the ABA design. In this experiment, we confirmed that avoidance behavior was restricted to walking. These results are readily explained by the behavior systems approach. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A ""system"" may be defined as the addition of an antiseptic bath(s) or shower(s) within 24 hours before the application of a Food and Drug Administration-compliant patient preoperative skin preparation at the time of surgery The expected outcome from this added effort is a further reduction in the transient and normal flora that contaminate the skin surrounding the operative site, and contribute to surgical infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the addition of this step to the preoperative site preparation regimen. Methods: A human in vivo study comparing an alcohol-based (ethanol) system to an iodine-based approach, and 2 sets of clinical observations, are presented here. Results: The data confirm the utility of the systems approach. The in vivo study demonstrates that significant reductions (greater than or equal to2 log(10)) in normal and transient flora can be achieved quickly and maintained out to 72 hours after the surgery, allowing for wound closure in a prolonged state of skin antisepsis. Clinical observations support the in vivo findings. After initiation of the system, the infection rates for the monitored procedures have decreased. Conclusions: The data presented here delineate the merits of a systems approach to preoperative surgical patient skin preparation. This approach has a positive impact on infection rates and may reduce the additional costs associated with this preventable event.","Healthpoint Ltd, Res & Dev, Div Surg, San Antonio, TX 78215 USA; Metropolitan Hosp, Grand Rapids, MI USA","Seal, LA (reprint author), Healthpoint Ltd, Res & Dev, Div Surg, 318 McCullough St, San Antonio, TX 78215 USA.",,,,,,"BOYCE JM, 1990, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V11, P89; ZAMORA JL, 1985, SURGERY, V98, P25; KAISER AB, 1988, ANN THORAC SURG, V45, P35; WIHLBORG O, 1987, ANN CHIR GYNAECOL FE, V76, P263; GARIBALDI RA, 1988, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V9, P109; ROSENBERG A, 1976, SURG GYNECOL OBSTET, V143, P789; BRANDBERG A, 1981, SKIN MICROBILOGY REL, P98; Bruch M, 2003, HANDBOOK OF TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, P197; *CDCP, 1999, CONTR HOSP EPIDEMIOL, V20, P250; *CDCP, 1999, INFECT CONT HOSP EP, V20, P267; *CDCP, 1996, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V24, P380; *CDCP, 1997, HLTH STAT VIT HLTH S, V27; FARBER M, 2001, BLOODSTREAM INFECTIO; FDA, 1994, FED REG, V59, P31402; Hobson DW, 2003, HANDBOOK OF TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, P167; KRETZER EK, 1994, CHEM GERMICIDES HLTH, P149; LEAPE LL, 1991, NEW ENGL J MED, V324, P377, DOI 10.1056/NEJM199102073240605; Paulson DS, 2003, HANDBOOK OF TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, P117; PAULSON DS, 1999, TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIA, P53; Paulson DS, 2003, HANDBOOK OF TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, P123; PAULSON DS, 1993, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V21, P205, DOI 10.1016/0196-6553(93)90033-Z; Ripa S, 2003, HANDBOOK OF TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIALS: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, P77; TAYLOR GJ, 1990, AM J CARDIOL, V65, P309, DOI 10.1016/0002-9149(90)90293-A; WENZEL RP, 1997, PREVENTION CONTROL, P856",24,31,33,0,3,"MOSBY, INC",ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318 USA",0196-6553,,,AM J INFECT CONTROL,Am.

To determine the specific distinctness of these little-known species from Cavia aperea Erxleben, 1777 and Galea musteloides Meyen, 1832, crossbreeding between species was tried and it demonstrated that the two Cavia species will rarely cross in captivity to produce hybrids of much reduced fertility, whereas the Galea species could not be crossed. To analyze the phylogenetic position of C. magna and Galea sp. nov., we present an analysis based on major parts of the 12S (778 base pair) and 16S genes of mitochondrial RNA (1435 base pair) in conjunction with corresponding data on all other genera of the Caviinae. We also determined the relationship between C. magna and the sympatric wild guinea-pig (C. aperea) and its domestic form (Cavia aperea f. porcellus (Linnaeus, 1758)). Phylogenetic and distance analysis of all genera of cavies (Cavia (two species), Galea (two species), Kerodon, Microcavia) showed the close relationship of C. magna with C. aperea and the latter's particularly low genetic distance to C. aperea f. porcellus. Galea sp. nov. differed markedly from G. musteloides. Of the three genera, Galea appears most distinct. The genus Kerodon clustered with the genus Hydrochaeris, supporting the previous conclusion by Rowe and Honeycutt (2002. Mol. Biol.

Significant improvements in many aspects (performance, cost, development time) of the development process can therefore be achieved by: 1) relating and integrating these different formalisms; 2) automatic derivation of different levels of modeling abstractions; and 3) rigorous and tailored design of. the different formalisms by capturing the domain (or meta) knowledge. The emerging field of computer automated multiparadigm modeling (CAMPaM), presented in this paper in the context of control system design, aims to develop a domain-independent formal framework that leverages and unifies different activities in each of these three dimensions.","MathWorks Inc, Real Time & Simulat Technol Grp, Natick, MA 01760 USA; Tennessee State Univ, Inst Software Integrated Syst, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; Univ Dortmund, Proc Control Lab, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Mosterman, PJ (reprint author), MathWorks Inc, Real Time & Simulat Technol Grp, Natick, MA 01760 USA.",pieter_j_mosterman@mathworks.com; sztipaj@vuse.vanderbilt.edu; s.engell@bci.uni-dortmund.de,,,,,"*ADAMS, 2002, US MAN; Barros F.

Quantitative descriptions of the forming procedures and the conditions of the adhesion interface forming can provide a guidance to the design of the soil-engaging component surfaces with a good anti-adhesion performance. Using a self-developed soil adhesion measurement device, the mean area and mean thickness of the adhesion interface waterfilm and the interfacial adhesion force varied with soil water content and vertical loads are measured. According to the gray system theory, the differential equations of the mean area and the mean thickness of waterfilm and the adhesion force of the interface are developed. The consequences between or among the factors related to the adhesion interface forming process are analyzed quantitatively with the gray correlation analyzing theory. The forming procedure of the adhesion interface and the influence on the mechanic behaviour of soil adhering on a solid surface are demonstrated by the experiments. The analysis will be beneficial to designing of soil-engaging component surfaces of terrain-machines.","Jilin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Terrain Machine Bion Engn, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China","Zhang, L (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Terrain Machine Bion Engn, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China.",lzh@jlu.edu.cn,,,,,"Ren LQ, 1995, J TERRAMECHANICS, V32, P303, DOI 10.1016/0022-4898(96)00001-8; CHEN BC, 1981, DYNAMICS SOIL VEHICL; DENG JL, 1987, FUNDAMENTAL METHODS, P11; FOUNTAINE ER, 1954, J SOIL SCI, V5, P251; Gill W., 1968, AGR HDB, V316; QIAN DH, 1965, T CHINESE SOC AGR MA, V8, P145; REN LQ, 1999, P 13 INT C ISTVS MUN, V14, P673; REN LQ, 1992, P 3 AS PAC C ISTVS A, P227; Ren LuQuan, 2000, Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery, V31, P5; Ren LQ, 1990, T CHINESE SOC AGR EN, V6, P1; Tong J, 1994, INT AGR ENG J, V3, P59; TONG J, 1994, J TERRAMECHANICS, V3, P93; ZHANG JX, 1986, T CHINESE SOC AGR MA, V29, P32",13,5,7,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1002-0071,,,PROG NAT SCI,Prog.

In the system the physiological impedance of systemic circulation was modeled as a resistance-capacitance-resistance type. The system analysis was directly based on differential equations describing the system dynamics, and numerically solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Results showed that pressure in the systemic circulation test rig could be successfully simulated with the developed model. From the numerical experiment, it was found that the maximum stroke of the driving mechanism, the flow coefficients and opening of the control valves, and the initial volume of air in the compliance strongly affect the dynamic performance of the test rig. The numerical method developed is a useful tool in the design and optimization of the system configuration.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Yeo, TJH (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Prod Engn, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,,,,,"FERRARI G, 1992, J BIOMED ENG, V14, P91, DOI 10.1016/0141-5425(92)90014-C; Brucker C, 1997, EXP FLUIDS, V22, P496, DOI 10.1007/s003480050077; Sharp MK, 1999, ASAIO J, V45, P535, DOI 10.1097/00002480-199911000-00006; ARTIOLI E, 1994, MED ENG PHYS, V16, P484, DOI 10.1016/1350-4533(94)90073-6; BAI J, 1992, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V30, P317, DOI 10.1007/BF02446970; DELAZZARI C, 1994, MED ENG PHYS, V16, P97, DOI 10.1016/1350-4533(94)90022-1; De Lazzari C, 1998, MED ENG PHYS, V20, P83, DOI 10.1016/S1350-4533(98)00008-3; Feng ZG, 2000, ARTIF ORGANS, V24, P346, DOI 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2000.06498.x; Fung YC, 1990, BIOMECHANICS MOTION; Graen MD, 1999, ASAIO J, V45, P204, DOI 10.1097/00002480-199905000-00019; Granet I, 1996, FLUID MECH; IHLEN H, 1992, AM HEART J, V123, P151, DOI 10.1016/0002-8703(92)90759-O; Kikugawa D, 2000, ARTIF ORGANS, V24, P632, DOI 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2000.06598.x; Lambert J.

The model follows the principles of participatory management where local stakeholders are fully engaged in different phases and stages of planning and decision-making. The process starts with an open exploration of views and perspectives from all participants. Collaborative or participative modelling follows where the multiple views, perspectives and concerns are systematically organised and structured into a qualitative model describing the interrelationships, interactions, and causality relationships of the different management components, particularly the relevant indicators. The modelling process allows direct participation and involvement of all stakeholders. Hence, the resultant model is a product of the collective knowledge, expertise, and experience of the stakeholders.

Invented by the large defense and aerospace companies decades ago, space astronomy projects have long embraced systems engineering. While it is much easier to fix problems after the fact, ground-based projects have taken longer to embrace this approach. As ground-based projects have grown in size and complexity, discovering the benefits of a systems approach has taken time. The up-front costs should be compared to the intended savings at the end of a project in order to find a balance in applying systems engineering tools. Based upon size and complexity of a project, one might expect a different balance in the rigorous application of systems engineering discipline when applied to the ground-based systems of today, The question is, as future ground-based systems increase an order of magnitude in complexity and cost, will this push the systems implementation closer to that of complex space systems? Thoughts will be presented for future giant telescopes based upon experience outside of astronomy, as well as systems implementation on the Gemini 8-meter Telescopes Project and for the new Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST).","Natl Opt Astron Observ, Natl Solar Observ, Tucson, AZ 85726 USA","Oschmann, JM (reprint author), Natl Opt Astron Observ, Natl Solar Observ, Tucson, AZ 85726 USA.",,,,,,"Craig S, 2003, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V4837, P178, DOI 10.1117/12.458233; REILLY NB, 1993, SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS E",2,2,2,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-5429-X,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2004,5497,,,,,,1,10,,10.1117/12.552156,,10,"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Engineering, Industrial; Instruments & Instrumentation; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Astronomy & Astrophysics; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BBB64,WOS:000224579200001,S,"Craig, S; Born, A",,"Craig, SC; Cullum, MJ",,"Craig, S; Born, A",,,Applying systems engineering to astronomical projects,MODELING AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING FOR ASTRONOMY,PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE),,English,Proceedings Paper,Conference on Modeling and Systems Engineering for Astronomy,"JUN 24-25, 2004","Glasgow, SCOTLAND",SPIE,,systems engineering; project management; UK ATC; VISTA,,"With the award of the VISTA(1) project to the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC), the need for a formal systems approach and dedicated systems engineering management was identified as a key requirement for the success of that project. The structuring of projects within the UK ATC has been increasingly biased toward a systems engineering approach. ROE projects such as CGS4, while very successful, were based on a traditional engineering discipline approach. The systems responsibility was split between the Project Scientist and the Project Manager. Such an approach can be made to work on internal projects where the entire team and project sponsor are in close proximity. As instrumentation projects have grown larger, become more complex and increasingly geographically distributed through international collaboration, the need for technical discipline enforced by a formal system engineering approach has correspondingly grown. Internal projects also benefit and are becoming increasingly reliant on systems engineering as a means to mitigating both schedule and budget risks. This paper describes and analyses the ongoing introduction of a formal systems approach within the UK ATC. Structuring of projects through a sub-system approach rather than by discipline, formal requirements capture, traceability and the use of systems tools to monitor performance are described. The introduction of systems engineering as a discipline is discussed and progress to date reported. Systems engineering activities in previous projects and ongoing implementation in current projects are analysed. Lessons learnt are described and future development in the systems approach outlined.","Royal Observ, UK Astron Technol Ctr, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland","Craig, S (reprint author), Royal Observ, UK Astron Technol Ctr, Blackford Hill, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,"*SPIE, 549742 SPIE; *SPIE, 483718 SPIE",2,3,3,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-5429-X,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2004,5497,,,,,,71,80,,10.1117/12.551384,,10,"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Engineering, Industrial; Instruments & Instrumentation; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Astronomy & Astrophysics; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BBB64,WOS:000224579200008,S,"Woo, T; Diong, B; Mansfield, L; Goldman, M; Nava, P; Nazeran, H",,,ieee,"Woo, T; Diong, B; Mansfield, L; Goldman, M; Nava, P; Nazeran, H",,,A comparison of various respiratory system models based on parameter estimates from impulse oscillometry data,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-7",PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY,,English,Proceedings Paper,26th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society,"SEP 01-05, 2004","San Francisco, CA","IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Whitaker Fdn, Cyberonics, NIH, NIBIB, NIDOCD, NINDS",,impulse oscillometry; respiratory impedance; respiratory system models,IMPEDANCE DATA,"Impulse oscillometry offers an advantage over spirometry when conducting pulmonary function tests.

In particular, the data can be used to obtain parameter estimates for electric circuit-based models of the respiratory system, which can in turn aid the detection and diagnosis of various diseases/pathologies. Of the six models analyzed during this study, the DuBois model and a newly proposed extended RIC model seem to provide the most robust parameter estimates for our entire data set of 106 subjects with various respiratory ailments such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The three systems model previously proposed by us suggests a framework to facilitate understanding , identify a child's needs and specify the appropriate treatment option. In this study we sought to investigate the model in clinical practice in a group of children with severe nocturnal enuresis, with particular reference to pharmacological treatment. Material and Methods: A total of 66 children were assessed using a schedule for identifying mono- and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, and were administered either desmopressin (0.4 mg) or anticholinergic medication (5-10 mg), respectively. Children were assessed at 4 weeks. with those failing to meet the success criterion being offered combination treatment for a further 4 weeks. Results: Success rates for monotherapy were 49% and 33% for desmopressin and anticholinergic medication, respectively, with an overall success rate of 74.5%, including those who went on to combination treatment. Good clinical signs were identified for those successfully treated with anticholinergic medication. Conclusions: This Study endorses the three systems approach in clinical practice.","E Leeds Primary Care Trust, Dept Clin Psychol, Child & Adolescent Mental Hlth Serv, Leeds LS19 7XY, W Yorkshire, England; Leeds Acute Hosp Trust, Dept Paediat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Butler, RJ (reprint author), E Leeds Primary Care Trust, Dept Clin Psychol, Child & Adolescent Mental Hlth Serv, Unite 2,Whackhouse Lane,Gateway, Leeds LS19 7XY, W Yorkshire, England.",richard.butler@leedsmh.nhs.uk,,,,,"Bower WF, 1996, BRIT J UROL, V78, P602, DOI 10.1046/j.1464-410X.1996.13618.x; Neveus T, 2001, J UROLOGY, V166, P2459, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(05)65616-9; Kosar A, 1999, SCAND J UROL NEPHROL, V33, P115; MIKKELSEN EJ, 1980, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V37, P1139; Butler RJ, 2000, SCAND J UROL NEPHROL, V34, P270; MONDA JM, 1995, J UROLOGY, V154, P745, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)67152-0; Butler R, 2001, BJU INT, V88, P563, DOI 10.1046/j.1464-410X.2001.02373.x; BUTLER RJ, 2004, IN PRESS SCAND J URO; BUTLER RJ, 2002, NOCTURNAL ENURESIS R; Caione P, 1997, EUR UROL, V31, P459; Cendron M, 1998, BRIT J UROL, V81, P26, DOI 10.1046/j.1464-410x.1998.00003.x; Chiozza ML, 1998, BRIT J UROL, V81, P53, DOI 10.1046/j.1464-410x.1998.00009.x; Devitt H, 1999, ARCH DIS CHILD, V80, P448; Hjalmas K, 1998, BRIT J UROL, V82, P704; KASS EJ, 1979, J UROLOGY, V121, P794; Watanabe H, 1995, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V173, P37; Kruse S, 1999, SCAND J UROL NEPHROL, V33, P49; Lettgen B, 1997, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V183, P47; MOFFATT MEK, 1993, PEDIATRICS, V92, P420; NIJMAN RJM, 2002, INCONTINENCE, P515; NORGAARD JP, 1989, J PEDIATR-US, V114, P705, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3476(89)80885-6; NORGAARD JP, 1995, J UROLOGY, V153, P1984, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)67385-3; Nrgaard J P, 1991, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V140, P1; NORGAARD JP, 1985, J UROLOGY, V134, P1029; Rittig S, 1989, AM J PHYSIOL, V256, P664; Skoog SJ, 1997, J UROLOGY, V158, P1035, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)64383-0; van Gool J D, 1999, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V202, P8; von Gontard A, 1998, J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC, V39, P439, DOI 10.1017/S0021963098002212; WATANABE H, 1994, EUR UROL, V25, P43; Watanabe H, 1995, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V173, P55; Watanabe H, 1997, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V183, P7; Wolfish N, 1999, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V202, P24; Yeung C K, 1999, Scand J Urol Nephrol Suppl, V202, P20",33,8,8,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"CORT ADELERSGT 17, PO BOX 2562, SOLLI, 0202 OSLO, NORWAY",0036-5599,,,SCAND J UROL NEPHROL,Scand.

In this paper, mobile commerce market formation is studied as a social economic system, which is dynamic and whose states change continuously. The model-building process incorporates a wide variety of sources of knowledge ranging from system thinking, through international marketing and management science, to system dynamics. The resulting simulation models are developed upon the mental models of a group of experts and available information from written documents, web forum, and online workshops. A simulation model is empirically established and simulated for the Chinese market. The model development and related analysis provides a typical example in using system dynamics to understand the process of mobile commerce diffusion and decision-making.","RMIT Univ, Fac Business, Sch Business Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Wang, WQ (reprint author), RMIT Univ, Fac Business, Sch Business Informat Technol, Level 17,239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",,,,,,"BASS FM, 1969, MANAGE SCI, V15, P215, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215; COYLE RG, 1996, SYSTEM DYNAMICS METH; Deaton M.

This paper argues that the capacity of the innovation system to respond to complex technological contexts will now determine the success of BNE The current rekindling of interest in BNF is a process internal to agricultural innovation systems. This paper presents an 'innovation systems' analytical framework that addresses institutional and technological changes necessary for the generation and utilization of BNF The systems perspective is essential because BNF innovation systems straddle both biological and social systems. It demands fundamental changes in the linear model of R&D that compartmentalizes innovation into research, extension and adoption boxes/organizations. An iterative institutional and technological learning process, building partnerships with relevant actors (not limited to participation in adoption) is necessary. The paper analyses the division between technological and social realms in conventional BNF technology generation. It reveals that a BNF innovation system makes demands from all stakeholders-professionals and society in general - to enable the nesting of BNF into larger system dynamics and land management goals. Research managers and policy makers must now identify and deliberate a range of incentives, capabilities and facilitation processes or institutional reforms that will bring the diverse actors together and enable their learning and evolution as part of the BNF innovation system.","Natl Inst Sci Technol & Dev Studies, New Delhi 110012, India","Raina, RS (reprint author), Natl Inst Sci Technol & Dev Studies, New Delhi 110012, India.",,"Hall, Andrew/H-8691-2015",,,,"African Association for Biological Nitrogen Fixation (AABNF), 2001, MIDT STRAT COLL BNF; Hall A, 2001, WORLD DEV, V29, P783, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00004-3; HAGEDORN K, 1993, J ECON ISSUES, V27, P849; BIGGS SD, 1990, WORLD DEV, V18, P1481, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(90)90038-Y; Biggs S, 1999, PUBLIC ADMIN DEVELOP, V19, P231, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-162X(199908)19:3<231::AID-PAD71>3.0.CO;2-E; BIGGS SD, 1981, WORLD DEV, V9, P321, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(81)90080-2; BAUR H, 2001, UNPUB ESTABLISHING P; Biggs S, 1998, WORLD DEV, V26, P239, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(97)10041-9; BROMLEY DW, 1985, J ECON ISSUES, V19, P779; *CIAT TSBF WORK GR, 2002, INT WORKSH BIOL NITR; Douthwaite B., 2002, ENABLING INNOVATION; Edquist C., 1997, SYSTEMS INNOVATION T, P41; FIELD AJ, 1984, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V32, P683, DOI 10.1086/451421; Freeman C., 1987, TECHNOLOGY EC PERFOR; Gibbons M., 1994, NEW PRODUCTION KNOWL; Gupta Akhil, 2000, POSTCOLONIAL DEV AGR; HALL A, 1995, WORLD DEV, V23, P1601, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(95)00057-J; HALL AJ, 2002, N S COOP INT C 3 DEC; HALL AJ, 1994, THESIS U SUSSEX BRIG; Herdt R.

Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent ""resilience"" by taking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps: identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.","Eco Nom LLC, Columbus, OH 43221 USA","Fiksel, J (reprint author), Eco Nom LLC, 2351 Kensington Dr, Columbus, OH 43221 USA.",,,,,,"Anastas PT, 2003, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V37, p94A, DOI 10.1021/es032373g; Holling CS, 2001, ECOSYSTEMS, V4, P390, DOI 10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5; Williams ED, 2002, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V36, P5504, DOI 10.1021/es025643o; Dewulf JP, 2002, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V36, P1130, DOI 10.1021/es010140o; Bakshi BR, 2003, AICHE J, V49, P1350, DOI 10.1002/aic.690490602; BAKSHI B, 2003, AICHE J; Benyus J, 1997, BIOMIMICRY INNOVATIO; Consoli F., 1993, GUIDELINES LIFE CYCL; *CTR WAST RED TECH, 2000, AICHE; De Geus A, 1997, LIVING CO; Elkington J, 1997, CANNIBALS FORKS TRIP; Fiksel J., 1996, DESIGN ENV CREATING; Fiksel J, 2002, ADV SUSTAINABILITY G; FIKSEL J, 2003, CORPORATE STRATEGY T, pR7; Fiksel J., 1993, Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications, V1, DOI 10.1177/1063293X9300100201; FIKSEL J, 2000, SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION; Ford A., 1999, MODELING ENV INTRO S; Foster R., 2001, CREATIVE DESTRUCTION; Global Reporting Initiative, 2002, SUST REP GUID; GUNDERSON LH, 2002, RESILENCE BEHAV LARG; HAMEL G, 2003, HARVARD BUSINESS SEP, P52; HART S, 1999, SLOAN MANAGE REV, V41; HAWKEN P, 2001, NATURAL CAPITALISM C; HEERWAGEN J, 1997, ENERGY ENV MANAG SPR, P29; Heylighen F., 2000, PRINCIPIA CYBERNETIC; LANKEY RL, 2002, ADV SUSTAINABILITY G; LANSING J.

We extend an earlier theoretical model of Shu (1987 PhD Thesis Universitat Karlsruhe) by accounting for additional characteristics of the turbulent pipe flow and making use of characteristic turbulence parameters. The velocity obtained by cross-correlation of the phase-modulated ultrasound signals can be predicted with the theoretical model as a function of the Reynolds number. These theoretical predictions agree favourably with experimental results. It is shown that the velocity determined by cross-correlation is nearly the 'modal value' of the turbulent velocity profile and, thereby, higher than the bulk velocity in the pipe. The investigations include studies of the influence of a number of parameters that can be varied in a practical set-up. It is shown that a calibration of the system, as it is done in practice, is only valid for a specific set of values of these parameters and restricted to fully developed flow in the pipe.","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Lehrstuhl Stromungslehre, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Univ Essen Gesamthsch, Lehrstuhl Stromungslehre, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",wolfgang.merzkirch@uni-essen.de,,,,,"Worch A, 1998, MEAS SCI TECHNOL, V9, P622, DOI 10.1088/0957-0233/9/4/010; EGGELS JGM, 1994, J FLUID MECH, V268, P175, DOI 10.1017/S002211209400131X; PERRY AE, 1975, J FLUID MECH, V67, P257, DOI 10.1017/S0022112075000298; Westerweel J, 1996, EXP FLUIDS, V20, P165, DOI 10.1007/BF00190272; Beck MS, 1987, CROSS CORRELATION FL; BRAUN H, 1984, THESIS U KARLSRUHE; Chernov L., 1960, WAVE PROPAGATION RAN; Herwig H., 1992, STROMUNGSMECHANIK; Hinze J.O., 1975, TURBULENCE; Kipphan H., 1978, Flow Measurement of Fluids.

Yet, a widespread misconception has taken hold of the OR/MS community: 'critical' and 'emancipatory' systems methodologies are opposed to 'hard' and 'soft' ones as if they were sensible alternatives. Accordingly, adequate 'methodology choice' is now widely considered a key condition of reflective professional practice; critical systems thinking (CST) is understood to deal mainly with this issue. The present paper argues that this conception of CST is neither theoretically sound nor conducive to reflective practice. An examination of the two major current strands of CST suggests some basic requirements of an alternative conception: (1) Reflective practice depends more on a framework of critical argumentation and discourse than on a framework of methodology choice. (2) A well-conceived discursive systems approach will give a proper place to the public sphere. (3) The much-discussed emancipatory orientation of CST inheres in the methodological requirements of discourse rather than in an arbitrary `commitment' on the part of the systems practitioner. (4) Systemic boundary critique-the methodological core concept of critical systems heuristics (CSH)-allows us to translate these requirements into practical methodology. (5) Contrary to present conceptions of methodological pluralism or 'complementarism', boundary critique must not be subordinated to methodology choice, for it is constitutive of all critical inquiry and practice. These considerations lead to a reconstitution of CST, and to a new view of reflective professional practice in general, as critically systemic discourse.","Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Ulrich, W (reprint author), Sichelweg 41, CH-3098 Schlieren, Switzerland.",,,,,,"Jackson MC, 1999, J OPER RES SOC, V50, P12, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600661; ULRICH W, 1987, EUR J OPER RES, V31, P276, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(87)90036-1; JACKSON MC, 1990, J OPER RES SOC, V41, P657; Midgley G, 1997, SYST PRACTICE, V10, P37, DOI 10.1007/BF02557850; JACKSON MC, 1993, J OPER RES SOC, V44, P208, DOI 10.2307/2584378; MINGERS J, 1992, J OPER RES SOC, V43, P1; KEYS P, 1988, SYST RES, V5, P65, DOI 10.1002/sres.3850050108; ULRICH W, 1980, INTERFACES, V10, P35, DOI 10.1287/inte.10.2.35; CHECKLAND P, 1985, J OPER RES SOC, V36, P757, DOI 10.2307/2582164; Checkland P.

We then describe the results of an actual method application project-the Brahms Mars Exploration Rover.

Since the expansion of near-shore aquaculture is becoming more difficult because of multi-use issues and environmental impact concerns, the feasibility of moving aquaculture into the open ocean is being studied. To enable the optimum design and evaluation of fish cage and mooring performance in the energetic open ocean, physical and numerical modeling techniques are being utilized. To validate these methods, the dynamics of a fish cage and mooring system deployed in the Gulf of Maine are simulated with physical and numerical models and compared with field observations. Assuming that the system can be modeled as a linear system, a stochastic approach was used to analyze the motion response (heave, surge and pitch) characteristics of the fish cage and the load (tension) response in an anchor line to wave forcing. Transfer functions were calculated from field observations for storm events and used to understand the system dynamics and to validate the models for the deployed system. Fish cage heave and surge motions were found to be overdamped, while pitch exhibited a resonance at low frequencies (less than 0.1 Hz). Transfer functions for anchor line tension were consistent with observations over most of the wave frequencies. The physical model clearly revealed the pitch resonance, while the numerical model was better at predicting mooring line tension. Results also provided insight concerning dynamical processes that require further study, including fluid-net panel interaction, transfer function amplitude dependence and the nonlinear relationship between steady current and wave fluid velocity on drag and its effect on system geometry and therefore response.

Influencing complex system designs in ways cognizant of human-system integration principles requires work products that are timely and tightly coupled to other elements of the design process. Because analyses were conducted simultaneously with the design processes regarding ship functionality and staffing, it was necessary to select and adapt cognitive work analysis methods to fit the demands of a time pressured and information-limited design situation. Interviews were conducted and analyzed based on aspects of an abstraction hierarchy and control task models. An abstraction hierarchy, a series of cross-linked matrices, and a set of decision ladder models were developed to provide a principled mapping between system function decompositions produced by system engineering teams and cognitive tasks, information needs, automation requirements, and concepts for displays. Cross-referencing the matrices supported design traceability and facilitated the integration of cognitive analyses with functional analyses being performed by other design teams. Results fed into design recommendations with respect to level of automation, human roles and initial display prototypes for the ship combat command center. The case study illustrates the utility of cognitive work analysis models (specifically, abstraction hierarchies and decision-ladder models) in the design of large-scale, first-of-a-kind systems, and presents new design artifacts that link concepts used in cognitive analyses to those used in systems engineering for more effective integration within the systems engineering process.

Systemic barriers impede the application of these strategies. A misaligned reimbursement system coupled with educational deficits and a lack of accountability has contributed to the institutionalization of substandard vascular access care. The hallmark of performance management is to create systems in which incentives are aligned to produce desired behaviors. Realigning reimbursement through a combination of pre-ESRD funding, enhancements to the composite rate to reward outcomes and cover vascular access monitoring and updated reimbursement for outpatient vascular access procedures would improve care and decrease unnecessary hospitalizations. This should be coupled with clearly defined outcome standards and accountability incorporated into hospital accreditation and credentialing. Capitation may provide alternative solutions. A two-phased approach including reimbursement reform while exploring capitation represents a prudent course with the best likelihood of success. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

This requires coordination of cell migration, cell-cell contact formation, and cell proliferation. Using time-lapse phase contrast videomicroscopy we have observed mammary gland epithelial cells over different time scales. We show the generation of a complete polarized epithelial monolayer in real-time, starting from a few cells. We subsequently concentrated on the early stages of this process by tracking epithelial cells during phases of polarized migration. We performed migration analysis using fractal measures. With this technology the structure of seemingly random processes not accessible to the usual methods of linear analysis can be measured. As a control and proof of principle approach we applied infection of cells with an adenoviral vector, which is used as a gene targeting vector for many applications. Infection markedly influenced the patterns of migratory behavior. We, therefore, believe that time-lapse videomicroscopy in combination with fractal analysis can contribute to differential characterization of distinct cellular migration patterns. This will be useful in situations of long-term alterations in cell culture systems.","Univ Innsbruck, Sch Med, Dept Histol & Mol Cell Biol, Inst Anat Histol & Embryol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Univ Vienna, Clin Inst Pathol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Sch Med, Inst Math, NuHAG, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Sch Med, Clin Dept Otorhinolaryngol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Huber, LA (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Sch Med, Dept Histol & Mol Cell Biol, Inst Anat Histol & Embryol, Mullerstr 59, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",lukas.a.huber@uibk.ac.at,,,,,"Czirok A, 1998, PHYS REV LETT, V81, P3038, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3038; LEE J, 1993, NATURE, V362, P167, DOI 10.1038/362167a0; Thurner S, 1998, PHYS REV LETT, V81, P5688, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5688; Adams CL, 1996, J CELL BIOL, V135, P1899, DOI 10.1083/jcb.135.6.1899; Thurner S, 1998, PHYS REV LETT, V80, P1544, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.1544; Sedivy R, 2002, J PATHOL, V197, P163, DOI 10.1002/path.1118; Calderwood DA, 2001, NAT CELL BIOL, V3, P1060, DOI 10.1038/ncb1201-1060; AGGELER J, 1991, J CELL SCI, V99, P407; Fialka I, 1996, J CELL BIOL, V132, P1115, DOI 10.1083/jcb.132.6.1115; MCNEILL H, 1993, J CELL BIOL, V120, P1217, DOI 10.1083/jcb.120.5.1217; Chicurel M, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P606, DOI 10.1126/science.295.5555.606; Oliferenko S, 2000, J CELL BIOL, V148, P1159, DOI 10.1083/jcb.148.6.1159; Mombach JCM, 1996, PHYS REV LETT, V76, P3032, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3032; Hennighausen L, 1998, GENE DEV, V12, P449, DOI 10.1101/gad.12.4.449; Adams CL, 1998, J CELL BIOL, V142, P1105, DOI 10.1083/jcb.142.4.1105; ROBINSON GW, 1995, DEVELOPMENT, V121, P2079; Schedin P, 2000, J MAMMARY GLAND BIOL, V5, P211, DOI 10.1023/A:1026447506666; Lauffenburger DA, 1996, CELL, V84, P359, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81280-5; Oliferenko S, 1999, J CELL BIOL, V146, P843, DOI 10.1083/jcb.146.4.843; Thurner S, 1997, FRACTALS, V5, P565, DOI 10.1142/S0218348X97000462; Michou AI, 1999, J VIROL, V73, P1399; Foster JS, 2001, TRENDS ENDOCRIN MET, V12, P320, DOI 10.1016/S1043-2760(01)00436-2; Park CC, 2000, MOL MED TODAY, V6, P324, DOI 10.1016/S1357-4310(00)01756-1; Bassingthwaighte JB, 1994, FRACTAL PHYSL; Bissell M J, 1999, Cancer Res, V59, P1757; Maheshwari G, 2001, J CELL BIOL, V155, P1123, DOI 10.1083/jcb.200109060; MANDELBR.BB, 1968, SIAM REV, V10, P422, DOI 10.1137/1010093; Thurner S, 2002, AUDIOL NEURO-OTOL, V7, P240, DOI 10.1159/000063740; THURNER S, 2002, IN PRESS PHYSICA A; Vietor I, 2002, EMBO J, V21, P4621, DOI 10.1093/emboj/cdf461",30,17,18,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0948-6143,,,HISTOCHEM CELL BIOL,Histochem.

The design of such a system involving optoelectronic, electronic, thermal, mechanical, chemical and data processing noise components presents difficult engineering problem from the complex of noise spectrum contributions. This project provides perhaps an important case study for optical engineers because it was developed over a period of 15 years. The design history recorded in the data entropy-time graph, shows clearly the step-wise improvements achieved from the various engineering efforts. The present 11-bits information content of the instrument, with impressive signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 1000:1, was developed from prototype with less than 3-bit resolution. The paper concludes with an assessment of the relevance of this method to optical engineering in which a diverse number of technologies are frequently integrated in products and systems. Finally; the role of data entropy methods in third level education is then briefly considered with very clear lessons drawn from the foregoing concrete example offered by this case study.","Dublin Inst Technol, Dublin 8, Ireland","Tiernan, K (reprint author), Dublin Inst Technol, Dublin 8, Ireland.",,,,,,"DOYLE G, UNPUB APPL DIGITAL D; MCMILLAN ND, 1997, DROP VOLUME TECHNIQU; MCMILLAN ND, 1992, REV SCI INSTRUM, V63, P216; ONEILL M, 2001, THESIS CARLOW; RIEDEL S, 2003, THESIS; Shannon C., 1949, P IRE, V37; SHANNON CE, 1948, BSTJ, V27",7,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4657-2,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2003,4876,,1&2,,,,1357,1373,,10.1117/12.468519,,17,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics",Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics,BW56V,WOS:000182425100150,B,"Aktan, AE; Faust, D",,"Wu, ZS; Abe, M",,"Aktan, AE; Faust, D",,,"A holistic integrated systems approach to assure the mobility, efficiency, safety and integrity of highway transportation","STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING AND INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE, VOLS 1 AND 2",,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring and Intelligent Infrastructure,"NOV 13-15, 2003","TOKYO, JAPAN","Japan Soc Civil Engineers, Japan Soc Promot Sci, minist Educ, Culture, Sport, Sci & Technol, Amer Concrete Inst, Alliance Global Sustainabil, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, China Civil Engn Soc, Intelligent Sensing Innovat Structure, Int Assoc Struct Control, Japan Concrete Inst, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Natl Sci Fdn, Soc Infrastruct Maintenance Engn",,,,"The highway transportation infrastructure is a hyper-system with a large variety of interconnected constructed,and manufactured elements, human elements, organizations, and social systems; therefore, a systems approach is necessary to assure its mobility, efficiency, safety and integrity.

Our preliminary study showed two things about critical systems thinking. First, it provides comprehensive and creative insight into tackling the increasing complexity of human knowledge and knowledge management processes through the organic connection and division of knowledge systems. Second, it encourages the critical use of available methodologies in a coherent way to cope with corresponding subsystems or processes, which breaks down the complexity into convenient units. Based on critical systems thinking, we divided knowledge into two aspects: static substance knowledge and dynamic process knowledge. This division not only provides a concise theoretical framework but also allows knowledge managers and workers to clearly understand the gravity of their work and to selectively utilize well-established methodologies in the practice of knowledge-related activities. This paper serves as an introduction to an application of critical system thinking and total systems intervention in diversified human knowledge topics.

The large fluctuations in the biomass of the Barents Sea capelin have been poorly understood and collapses in the biomass have occurred. A system analysis of the capelin stock has identified a state differential equation model and a frequency transfer function model of the stock properties. The results of this research show that the capelin stock dynamics is adapted to the 18.6 year and the 18.6/3 = 6.2 year lunar nodal tide that influences the temperature in the Barents Sea. An analysis of the capelin time series has identified a 6.2 yr cycle of recruitment, maturity and fish stock growth. An estimated frequency response of a stock-number, life-cycle model has identified a stochastic resonance of about half of the 6.2 yr cycle. The stochastic resonance shows that fluctuation of the stock number is a natural adaptation to the environment and a strategy for optimal growth and survival in the long run. In this stochastic resonance timing between the stock number fluctuation and the 6.2 yr cycle is most important. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Recent progress in metabolic engineering methodologies to improve metabolic pathways in microorganisms was reviewed with many studies in this paper. Metabolic flux distribution was analyzed under different environmental conditions, using a metabolic reaction model. The physiological states of microorganisms were understood by interpreting metabolic flux analysis (MFA). This analysis was also used for development of process operation and control strategy. Cell capability to form a targeted product was analyzed with a metabolic reaction model and linear programming (LP). The use of a C-13-enriched carbon source and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses of intracellular and extracellular metabolites enabled determination of a metabolic flux distribution more accurately than the flux distribution determined only by the metabolic reaction model, which involves not only metabolite balances but also energy and redox balances. The comparison of metabolic flux distributions between before and after genetic modification of cells yielded information on the mechanism of regulation of metabolic flux in microorganisms. Finally, integration of bioinformatics and metabolic engineering is discussed, and cyclic modification of the complex bionetwork and process development were emphasized.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Shimizu, H (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",,,,,,"Aiba S, 1973, BIOCH ENG; HEINRICH R, 1974, EUR J BIOCHEM, V42, P89, DOI 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03318.x; Dauner M, 2000, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V16, P642, DOI 10.1021/bp000058h; Hirasawa T, 2000, J BACTERIOL, V182, P2696, DOI 10.1128/JB.182.10.2696-2701.2000; Chauvatcharin S, 1998, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V58, P561, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19980620)58:6<561::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-G; VARMA A, 1993, J THEOR BIOL, V165, P477, DOI 10.1006/jtbi.1993.1202; Peters-Wendisch PG, 1998, MICROBIOL-UK, V144, P915; VARMA A, 1993, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V42, P59, DOI 10.1002/bit.260420109; Petersen S, 2001, METAB ENG, V3, P344, DOI 10.1006/mben.2001.0198; JORGENSEN H, 1995, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V46, P117, DOI 10.1002/bit.260460205; Christensen B, 2000, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V68, P652, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(20000620)68:6<652::AID-BIT8>3.0.CO;2-J; Edwards JS, 1998, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V58, P162, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19980420)58:2/3<162::AID-BIT8>3.0.CO;2-J; VARMA A, 1994, BIO-TECHNOL, V12, P994, DOI 10.1038/nbt1094-994; Hayashi M, 2002, BIOSCI BIOTECH BIOCH, V66, P1337, DOI 10.1271/bbb.66.1337; Oh MK, 2000, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V16, P278, DOI 10.1021/bp000002n; VALLINO JJ, 1994, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V10, P320, DOI 10.1021/bp00027a013; Nampoothiri KM, 2002, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V58, P89, DOI 10.1007/s00253-001-0861-z; Nielsen J, 2001, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V55, P263, DOI 10.1007/s002530000511; Schilling CH, 1999, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V15, P288, DOI 10.1021/bp9900357; Adachi E, 1998, J FERMENT BIOENG, V86, P284, DOI 10.1016/S0922-338X(98)80131-1; Vrljic M, 1996, MOL MICROBIOL, V22, P815, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2958.1996.01527.x; ZUPKE C, 1994, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V10, P489, DOI 10.1021/bp00029a006; VALLINO JJ, 1993, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V41, P633, DOI 10.1002/bit.260410606; VARMA A, 1993, APPL ENVIRON MICROB, V59, P2465; Kimura E, 1996, BIOSCI BIOTECH BIOCH, V60, P1565; Usuda Y, 1996, MICROBIOL-UK, V142, P3347; Ideker T, 2001, SCIENCE, V292, P929, DOI 10.1126/science.292.5518.929; Stephanopoulos G, 1997, CHEM ENG SCI, V52, P2607, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2509(97)00077-8; Rizzi M, 1997, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V55, P592; Cornish-Bowden A, 2000, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V18, P267, DOI 10.1038/73696; Toronen P, 1999, FEBS LETT, V451, P142, DOI 10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00524-4; Ehlde M, 1997, CHEM ENG SCI, V52, P2599, DOI 10.1016/S0009-2509(97)00076-6; Burgard AP, 2001, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V74, P364, DOI 10.1002/bit.1127; Raamsdonk LM, 2001, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V19, P45; DeRisi JL, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P680, DOI 10.1126/science.278.5338.680; AIBA S, 1979, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V21, P1373, DOI 10.1002/bit.260210806; PAPOUTSAKIS ET, 1985, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V27, P67, DOI 10.1002/bit.260270109; Bailey JE, 1998, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V14, P8, DOI 10.1021/bp9701269; BORMANN ER, 1992, MOL MICROBIOL, V6, P317, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1992.tb01474.x; Kawahara Y, 1997, BIOSCI BIOTECH BIOCH, V61, P1109; Chanprateep S, 2001, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V74, P116, DOI 10.1002/bit.1101; Peters-Wendisch PG, 2001, J MOL MICROB BIOTECH, V3, P295; KISS RD, 1991, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V7, P501, DOI 10.1021/bp00012a004; Lim SJ, 2002, J BIOSCI BIOENG, V93, P543, DOI 10.1263/jbb.93.543; Wiechert W, 2001, METAB ENG, V3, P195, DOI 10.1006/mben.2001.0187; NIELSEN J, 1995, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V11, P299, DOI 10.1021/bp00033a010; Neves AR, 1999, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V64, P200, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19990720)64:2<200::AID-BIT9>3.0.CO;2-K; Shi HD, 1999, J BIOSCI BIOENG, V87, P666, DOI 10.1016/S1389-1723(99)80132-7; Marx A, 1996, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V49, P111, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19960120)49:2<111::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-T; Yang C, 2002, J BIOSCI BIOENG, V93, P78, DOI 10.1263/jbb.93.78; VANDERHEIJDEN RTJM, 1994, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V43, P3, DOI 10.1002/bit.260430103; Ohnishi J, 2002, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V58, P217, DOI 10.1007/s00253-001-0883-6; Eggeling L, 1998, APPL MICROBIOL BIOT, V49, P24, DOI 10.1007/s002530051132; Edwards JS, 2000, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V97, P5528, DOI 10.1073/pnas.97.10.5528; Vanrolleghem PA, 1996, BIOTECHNOL PROGR, V12, P434, DOI 10.1021/bp960022i; PetersWendisch PG, 1997, MICROBIOL-SGM, V143, P1095; SONNTAG K, 1993, EUR J BIOCHEM, V213, P1325, DOI 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17884.x; Bailey J.

The atrioventricular node or its part were observed in 96 cases (87.3%), penetrating bundle in 92 cases (83.6%), branching and left bundles branch in 109 cases (99.1%) and right bundle branch in 73 cases (66.4%). The changes such as fibrosis and fatty infiltration show statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) between progressive age groups confirming their degenerative and age-related nature. The study included as well nine cases of sudden unexpected death and two cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), for which the autopsy with histological examination and toxicological analysis resulted negative. For nine of these cases, pathological lesions were found which can even explain the fatal issue. Moreover, in the cases with known cause of death, potentially lethal changes were noticed. This simple, low cost technique could be proposed to forensic pathologists as easy to fit into the routine processing of autopsy material, allowing the detection of major abnormalities with minimal effort. The authors also consider the difficulties related to the interpretation of the pathological findings in the conduction system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It is shown how the molecular structure of the electrolyte strongly influences ion transport through the polymer as well as across the interfaces and determines the values of a number of parameters needed for system models that can predict the performance of the battery (e.g. kappa, D, t(0)(+) and i(0)). The interaction of the electrolyte with the electrodes not only leads to transfer of the lithium ion across the interface but also to side reactions that profoundly influence the calendar and life cycle of the battery. Typically these electrochemically induced side reactions generate the SEI layer, but inherent instability of the bulk electrolyte may also play a role in the formation of surface layers. These various reactions can lead to changes in the mechanical properties of the separator and electrode structure that promote life-limiting phenomena such as dendrite growth, passivation and morphology changes. The rheological model of Eisenberg is drawn upon to show how the interactions of the electrolyte with surfaces can lead to distinct changes in mechanical and transport properties that may limit the battery performance and lead to diminished performance with time. The molecular level models may be combined with the rheological models to provide workable models of the interfaces and bulk electrolyte dynamics that in turn can be used to provide a more accurate level of performance prediction from the system models. This connects molecular structure with battery performance and guides the design and synthesis of new and better materials (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It was assumed that a curriculum developed to increase an engineer's capacity for ""engineering systems thinking"" might be developed on the basis of those characteristics. The principal questions that the study asked were: What qualifications (knowledge and skills) should a proficient systems engineers possess, and further, how is ""engineering systems thinking"" capability acquired? Raw data was gathered from 28 interviews, 14 lectures, and two observation sites. Eighty-three distinct categories of responses emerged.

The method is `trajectory following' in the sense that an initial guess for the solution is moved along a trajectory generated by the differential equations to a solution point. With the advent of fast computers and efficient integration solvers, this relatively old idea is now an attractive alternative to traditional optimization methods. One area in control theory that the trajectory following method is particularly useful is in the design of Lyapunov optimizing feedback controls. Such a controller is one in which the control at each instant in time either minimizes the `steepest decent' or `quickest decent' as determined from the system dynamics and an appropriate (Lyapunov- like) decent function. The method is particularly appealing in that it allows the Lyapunov control system design method to be used `on-line'. That is, the controller is part of a normal feedback loop with no off-line calculations required. This approach eliminates the need to solve two-point boundary value problems associated with classical optimal control approaches. We demonstrate the method with two examples. The first example is a nonlinear system with no constraints on the control and the second example is a linear system subject to bounded control.","Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Vincent, TL (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",vincent@u.arizona.edu; grantham@mme.wsu.edu,,,,,"Anderson M.

MTU acts as consortium leader. The company shares a license and technology exchange agreement with Fuel Cell Energy Inc., Danbury, CT, USA (formerly Energy Research Corp., ERC). The program was started in 1990 and covers a period of about 10 years. The highlights of this program to date are: Considerable improvements regarding component stability have been demonstrated on laboratory scale. Manufacturing technology has been developed to a point which enables the consortium to fabricate the porous components on a 250 cm 2 scale. Several large area stacks with 5000-7660 cm(2) cell area and a power range of 3-10 kW have been tested at the facilities in Munich (Germany) and Kyndby (Denmark). These stacks have been supplied by FCE. As far as the system design is concerned it was soon realized that conventional systems do not hold the promise for competitive power plants. A system analysis led to the conclusion that a new innovative design approach is required. As a result the ""Hot Module"" system was developed by the consortium. A Hot Module combines all the components of a MCFC system operating at the similar temperatures and pressures into a common thermally insulated vessel. In August 1997 the consortium started its first full size Hot Module MCFC test plant at the facilities of Ruhrgas AG in Dorsten, Germany. The stack was assembled in Munich using 292 cell packages purchased from FCE. The plant is based on the consortium's unique and proprietary ""Hot Module"" concept. It operates on pipeline natural gas and was grid connected on 16 August 1997. After a total of 1500 h of operation, the plant was intentionally shut down in a controlled manner in April 1998 for post-test analysis. The Hot Module system concept has demonstrated its functionality. The safety concept has been convincingly proven, though in part unintentionally. The electrical power level of 155 kW (ca. 60% of maximum power) achieved allows validation of the concept with reasonable degree of confidence. Horizontal stack operation-an essential innovation of the Hot Module concept-is feasible. The fuel processing subsystem worked reliably as expected. After initial problems in the inverter control software, the electrical and control subsystem operated to full satisfaction. Stable automatic operation not only under various load conditions, but also in idle mode, hot parking mode, and grid-independent mode has been demonstrated. Together with progress achieved by FCE in the qualification of large direct fuel cell (DFC) stacks the basis was laid for the next test unit of similar design, which will be operated in Bielefeld, Germany. The pre-tests of the stack took place already in July 1999 with good results. Additionally, projects for the test of the DFC Hot Module operating on biogas and other opportunity fuels are under preparation.

This celebrated origin story needs to be supplemented with a longer and larger history of both practice and thought about the family, and that is the subject of this article. The longer history goes back to the founding of social work by Mary Richmond, of pragmatism by William James, and of the organic view of social systems intervention by John Dewey. Seen against this background, family therapy is, among other things, a consequence of the development of persistent elements of American professional culture, experience, and philosophy. The taking of this historical-anthropological view discloses also the origins of two other histories that have made their contribution to the development of family therapy: a science of observing communication processes that starts with Edward Sapir and leads to contemporary conversation analysis, and a history of mesmerism in the United States that culminates in Milton Erickson and his followers.","Ackerman Inst Family, New York, NY USA","Beels, CC (reprint author), 865 W End Ave, New York, NY 10025 USA.",,,,,,"ANDERSON CM, 1981, NEW DEV INTERVENTION, P79; BOWEN M, 1966, COMPR PSYCHIAT, V7, P345, DOI 10.1016/S0010-440X(66)80065-2; Kogan SM, 1997, FAM PROCESS, V36, P101, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1997.00101.x; BATESON G, 1956, BEHAV SCI, V1, P251; GALE J, 1992, J MARITAL FAM THER, V18, P153, DOI 10.1111/j.1752-0606.1992.tb00926.x; Bateson G., 1987, ANGELS FEAR EPISTEMO; BEELS C, 2001, DIFFERENT STORY RISE; BELL JE, 1967, FAM PROCESS, V6, P254, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1967.00254.x; Caplan E., 1998, MIND GAMES AM CULTUR; COONTZ S, 1992, WAY WE NEVER WERER A; Darnton Robert, 1968, MESMERISM END ENLIGH; Faris R, 1967, CHICAGO SOCIOLOGY 19; Fuller Robert, 1982, MESMERISM AM CURE SO; GARRISON V, 1982, THERAPEUTIC INTERVEN, P58; Grinder John, 1976, STRUCTURE MAGIC, VII; GUERIN PJ, 1976, FAMILY THERAPY THEOR, P2; Hale NG, 1971, FREUD AM; Haley J., 1973, UNCOMMON THERAPY PSY; HARTMAN A, 1983, FAMILY CTR SOCIAL WO, P1; Herbert Mead George, 1962, MIND SELF SOC; HOFFMAN L, 1990, FAM PROCESS, V29, P1, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1990.00001.x; James W., 1902, VARIETIES RELIG EXPE; James W., 1981, PRINCIPLES PSYCHOL, V1-2; LEWIS J, 2000, DISARMING PAST INTIM; Lubove R., 1965, PROFESSIONAL ALTRUIS; Mandelbaum D., 1968, SELECTED WRITINGS E; MEYER D, 1980, POSITIVE THINKERS; MILLER J, 1995, NEW YORK REV BO 0420, P59; Minuchin S., 1974, FAMILIES FAMILY THER; NEWMARK M, 1994, FAM PROCESS, V33, P3, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1994.00003.x; NICHOLS WC, 1991, FAMILY THERAPY CONCE; PAUL L, 1962, FAM PROCESS, V1, P342, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1962.00342.x; PINSOF WM, 1995, J MARITAL FAM THER, V21, P585, DOI 10.1111/j.1752-0606.1995.tb00179.x; Richmond M., 1917, SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS; Ritterman M., 1983, USING HYPNOSIS FAMIL; SCHEFLEN AE, 1964, PSYCHIATR, V27, P316; SELVINIPALAZZOL.M, 1978, PARADOX COUNTERPARAD; Simon L., 1998, GENUINE REALITY LIFE; Walters M., 1988, INVISIBLE WEB; WINTER A, 1998, MESMERIZED POWERS MI; ZWERLING I, 1965, 2 STREAKER AWARD LEC",41,6,6,0,1,FAMILY PROCESS INC,ROCHESTER,"PO BOX 23980, ROCHESTER, NY 14692-3980 USA",0014-7370,,,FAM PROCESS,Fam.

Local cerebral blood flow is adjusted to cortical activity in a rapid and fine-tuned manner. The responsible mechanism, called neurovascular coupling, is suggested to be governed by a complex biological control system. The main characteristics of the regulative process can be modelled in terms of a control system of low order. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the overshoot and undershoot in haemodynamics are part of the regulative processes of the neurovascular coupling mechanism. Methods: Using a visual stimulation paradigm, the evoked blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery was measured in 20 healthy volunteers (aged 24.7 +/- 0.4 years, 12 males) with transcranial Doppler. The dynamic flow velocity response was evaluated according to a 5-parameter control system model. Results:The parameter time delay (1.2 +/- 1; 2.2 +/- 1.3; p < 0.05) and natural frequency (0.23 +/- 0.06; 0.47 +/- 0.18; p < 0.001) were significantly smaller, the parameter rate time (4.9 +/- 2.3; 2.2 +/- 1.6; p < 0.01) greater in conditions of stimulation. Conclusions: The finding of an identical control system model for both regulative conditions supports the hypothesis that the mechanism is mainly functionally governed and that the underlying biological elements do not appear to be limiting factors. The difference in parameters is suggested to reduce the time span of an initial hypoperfusion in conditions of cortical activation. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

They are successful in presenting new findings about landscapes within their specialisation, but collaboration-and thus, transfer of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries-is seldom realised because a common approach that bridges the gaps between disciplines is missing. Instead, different landscape concepts exist side by side. Yet, cooperation is required to tackle the various environmental and social problems related to landscapes. This paper provides an overview of the historical development of landscape concepts originating from different cultural and scientific trends, and presents a new complex concept of landscape, which is designed to enable transdisciplinary landscape research. The transdisciplinary landscape concept is based on five dimensions of landscapes: the spatial entity, the mental entity, the temporal dimension, the nexus of nature and culture, and the systemic properties of landscapes. In contrast to other approaches, it unites dimensions that are usually the domain of individual disciplines and makes it, thus, possible to capitalise on plurality in landscape research. The concept promotes landscape as the combination of the subsystems known as the geo-, bio- and noo-sphere, and is illustrated by the people-landscape interaction model, The concept can be applied to all human-landscape-related research, but is exemplified by two studies that have investigated the relationship between landscape and second-home tourism, and landscape and fanning, respectively.

We develop a rationale for a new approach to evaluation by describing the unique characteristics of complex systems and by showing that systems engineering techniques only partially accommodate these characteristics. We then present work domain analysis as a complementary framework for evaluation. We explain this technique by example by showing how the Australian Defence Force used work domain analysis to evaluate design proposals for a new system called Airborne Early Warning and Control. This case study also demonstrates that work domain analysis is a useful and feasible approach that complements standard techniques for evaluation and that promotes a central role for human factors professionals early in the system design and development process. Actual or potential applications of this research include the evaluation of designs for complex systems.","Def Sci & Technol Org, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Naikar, N (reprint author), Def Sci & Technol Org, POB 4331, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",neelam.naikar@dsto.defence.gov.au,"Sanderson, Penelope/A-5450-2008",,,,"Burns CM, 2000, HUM FACTORS, V42, P226, DOI 10.1518/001872000779656471; Naikar N, 1999, INT J AVIAT PSYCHOL, V9, P271, DOI 10.1207/s15327108ijap0903_5; WHITEFIELD A, 1991, BEHAV INFORM TECHNOL, V10, P65; BISANTZ AM, 1994, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V40, P83, DOI 10.1006/ijhc.1994.1005; CHARLTON SG, 1996, HDB HUMAN FACTORS TE, P13; CZAJA SJ, 1997, HDB HUMAN FACTORS ER, P594; *DEP DEF, 1995, CAP EQ PROC MAN CEPM; *DEP DEF, 1999, DEF PROC POL MAN DPP; Dinadis N, 1999, INT J AVIAT PSYCHOL, V9, P241, DOI 10.1207/s15327108ijap0903_4; GABB A, 1995, DSTOTR0194; GABB A, 1996, DSTOTR0303 EL SURV R; Leveson NG, 2000, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V26, P15, DOI 10.1109/32.825764; MALONE TB, 1996, HDB HUMAN FACTORS TE, P101; MEISTER D, 1986, ADV HUMAN FACTORS ER, P313; MEISTER D, 1996, HDB HUMAN FACTORS TE, P313; NAIKAR N, IN PRESS COGNITIVE S; NAIKAR N, 2000, DESIGNING NEW TEAMS; OBRIEN TG, 1996, HDB HUMAN FACTORS TE, P117; Pejtersen A., 1997, HDB HUMAN FACTORS ER, P1514; PERROW C, 1984, NORMAL ACCIDENTS LIV; Pool R., 1997, ENG SOC SHAPES TECHN; Rasmussen J, 1994, COGNITIVE SYSTEMS EN; RASUSSEN J, 1998, AFRLHETRWP19990011 W; Reason J., 1990, HUMAN ERROR; Reising DVC, 1996, PROCEEDINGS OF THE HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS SOCIETY - 40TH ANNUAL MEETING, VOLS 1 AND 2, P293; Sanderson P, 1999, HUM FAC ERG SOC P, P318; SANDERSON PM, 2000, 5 AUSTR AV PSYCH S M; VICENTE KJ, 1995, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V25, P529, DOI 10.1109/21.370186; Vicente K.J., 1999, COGNITIVE WORK ANAL; WALSH PA, 1989, ERGONOMICS, V32, P1483, DOI 10.1080/00140138908966919",30,30,30,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Implementing clinical practice guidelines to change patient outcomes presents a challenge. Studies of single interventions focused on changing provider behavior demonstrate modest effects, suggesting that effective guideline implementation requires a multifaceted approach. Traditional biomedical research designs are not well suited to evaluating systems interventions. OBJECTIVES. RAND and the Army Medical Department collaborated to develop and evaluate a system for implementing guidelines and documenting their effects on patient care. RESEARCH DESIGN. The evaluation design blended quality improvement, case study, and epidemiologic methods. A formative evaluation of implementation process and an outcome evaluation of patient impact were combined. SUBJECTS. Guidelines were implemented in 3 successive demonstrations targeting low back pain, asthma, and diabetes. This paper reports on the first wave of 4 facilities implementing a low back pain guideline. METHODS. Organizational climate and culture, motivation, leadership commitment, and resources were assessed. Selected indicators of processes and outcomes of care were compared before, during, and after guideline implementation at the demonstration facilities and at comparison facilities. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for guideline effects on patient care. RESULTS. Process evaluation documented varied approaches to quality improvement across sites. Outcome evaluation revealed a significant downward trend in the percentage of acute low back pain patients referred to physical therapy or chiropractic care (10.7% to 7.2%) at demonstration sites and no such trend at control sites. CONCLUSIONS. Preliminary results suggest the power of this design to stimulate improvements in guideline implementation while retaining the power to evaluate rigorously effects on patient care.","RAND Hlth, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; USA, Med Command, Houston, TX USA","Cretin, S (reprint author), RAND Hlth, POB 2138,1700 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",shan@rand.org,,,,,"Grol R, 1998, BRIT MED J, V317, P858; Wagner EH, 1996, MILBANK Q, V74, P511, DOI 10.2307/3350391; Davis D, 1999, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V282, P867, DOI 10.1001/jama.282.9.867; SHORTELL SM, 1995, HEALTH SERV RES, V30, P377; Evans RS, 1998, NEW ENGL J MED, V338, P232, DOI 10.1056/NEJM199801223380406; Von Korff M, 1997, ANN INTERN MED, V127, P1097; GRIMSHAW JM, 1993, LANCET, V342, P1317, DOI 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92244-N; Shortell SM, 1998, MILBANK Q, V76, P593, DOI 10.1111/1468-0009.00107; Bero LA, 1998, BRIT MED J, V317, P465; Overhage JM, 1997, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V4, P364; Worrall G, 1997, CAN MED ASSOC J, V156, P1705; TANNENBAUM SI, 1991, J APPL PSYCHOL, V76, P759, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.76.6.759; Austin S M, 1994, Proc Annu Symp Comput Appl Med Care, P121; CASANOVA JE, 1997, TOOLS TASK ROLE CLIN; CHODOFF P, 1995, J OUTCOMES MANAG, V2, P5; Davis David A., 1995, JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), V274, P700, DOI 10.1001/jama.274.9.700; DEHAR MA, 1993, EVALUATION REV, V17, P204, DOI 10.1177/0193841X9301700205; Eastwood AJ, 1996, QUAL HEALTH CARE, V5, P134, DOI 10.1136/qshc.5.3.134; Jackson R, 1998, BRIT MED J, V317, P427; Freemantle N, 1999, COCHRANE LIB; Gifford DR, 1999, ANN INTERN MED, V131, P237; Goldberg H I, 1998, Jt Comm J Qual Improv, V24, P130; GRILLI R, 1994, MED CARE, V32, P202, DOI 10.1097/00005650-199403000-00002; GRIMSHAW J, 1994, EFFECTIVE HLTH CARE, V8, P55; Gustafson DH, 1992, SYSTEMS SUPPORT HLTH; Hargraves JL, 1996, MED CARE, V34, pSS67; Horowitz CR, 1996, JOINT COMM J QUAL IM, V22, P734; KATON W, 1995, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V273, P1026, DOI 10.1001/jama.273.13.1026; Langley G, 1996, IMPROVEMENT GUIDE PR; LEWIS S, 1995, CAN MED ASSOC J, V153, P1073; Margolis C, 1999, IMPLEMENTING CLIN PR; Mittman B S, 1992, QRB Qual Rev Bull, V18, P413; MURREY KO, 1992, QRB              DEC, P423; Naylor J.

For infectious diseases, exposure might not only depend on exogenous sources of microbes, but also on the infection status of other individuals in the population. For example, waterborne infections from agents such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Escherichia coli: O157:H7 might be transmitted from contaminated water to humans through drinking water; from interpersonal contact; or from infected individuals to the environment, and back to other susceptible individuals. These multiple pathways and the dependency of exposure on the prevalence of infection in a population suggest that epidemiological models are required to complement standard risk assessments in order to quantify the risk of infection. This paper presents new models of infection transmission systems that are being developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency as part of a project to quantify the risk of microbial infection. The models are designed to help inform water treatment system design decisions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To ensure high yield within a manufacturing system many attributes and goals need to be considered. The authors aim to examine all of these and obtain the most suitable set-up for the manufacturing process. It is the author's view that to truly optimize a manufacturing system, the system needs to be examined as a whole, enabling the whole system to be optimized not individual sub-systems. This paper describes a three-phase framework for use in optimising electronic manufacturing systems using a systems approach. Phase 1 is the system-modeling phase where a model of the system to be optimized is created. Phase 2 involves system analysis and control. In this phase the focus is on identifying areas of the manufacturing process where analysis and control needs to be undertaken. A collection of techniques can be used systematically to generate such information and provide an understanding of an individual process's capability. These techniques include process capability indices, measurement operation evaluation indices and process failure mode and effect critical analysis. The final phase is used to optimize the system using techniques such as experimental design and response surface models. This paper describes the proposed framework, which has been validated within semiconductor, assembly and printed circuit board manufacturing plants. Within the semiconductor facility one of the stages of the framework investigated was the process capability ratio (PCR), stage IV of the framework. PCR techniques were used to explain the relationship between the technical specification and the production capabilities. Various PCR indices were used such as C-p, C-pk, and C-pm and these were generated for various gate turn off thyristor operations. The use of the C-pk indice is illustrated as a means of determining whether the process for gallium diffusion and gallium restivity are capable.","Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; Univ Urmia, Fac Engn, Urmia, Iran","Newnes, LB (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",,"NEWNES, LINDA/B-1668-2010",,,,"Arnold J.

Functional transcranial Doppler (f-TCD) investigations revealed a typical time course of evoked blood how responses with an initial overshoot and a stabilization at a lower, but stable, level, This blood Bow reaction can be described in terms of a control-system model, We tested reliability and validity of this new approach using different stimulation paradigms, The P2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery was insonated in 14 healthy volunteers and, subsequently, NC was stimulated using two tests, a checkerboard stimulus of 1 s with different repetition rates and a reading test. Data were analyzed according to algorithms of control-system theory. The reading test was used to measure test reliability and side differences, A second-order linear system can describe blood flow regulation of NC. Different stimulation protocols of the checkerboard test and the related evoked blood flow curves could he described by the same control-system model. Further, there were no differences between the checkerboard and reading test nor between right and Left side or test and retest of the reading test, NC can be described in a much more detailed manner using control-system analysis. We were able to show that blood flow response due to different visual stimuli follow one common control-system model. Unlike quantification of NC using overshoot, parameters of the control system have smaller SDs, increasing the statistical power and, thereby, usefulness: of f-TCD as a diagnostic instrument.

Adult patients who had been identified as requiring enteral tube feeding were allocated to receive sterile, whole protein enteral feed from either 2x1000 mL triple foil laminated pouches (Nutrison Standard, Nutrison Pack. Nutricia Ltd, UK) attached to a Flocare 800 pack giving set or from 2 x 1000 mt rigid plastic bottles (Osmolite, Ross Ready-to-Hang, Abbott Laboratories, UK) connected to a Patrol Pump set. Samples of feed from the nutrient containers were sent for microbiological analysis each time the container was changed (12 and 24 h) and samples from the distal ends of giving sets after 24 h. Bacterial contamination was found in a significantly lower number of Nutrison Packs (14/120; 12%) as compared with Ross Ready-to-Hang containers (25/120; 21%) (Fisher's exact test, 1 tailed test, P<0.05). However, both the level and frequency of contamination of the feed samples collected from the distal ends of the giving sets of both types of system were similar to each other but higher than those from the nutrient containers (57/120 contaminated giving sets as compared with 39/240 nutrient containers; P<0.00001). On 32/120 patient days only the giving set samples were contaminated. The results highlight the important role that improvements in system design, such as the use of recessed spikes on giving sets have in reducing the risk of bacterial contamination of enteral tube feeds introduced due to faulty handling procedures, and further implicate retrograde spread of the patients' own flora as a source of contamination in the giving set.

The link is so closed that, in the writing of Churchman seems to be a natural, almost genetic, link. Thirty years later we find that such concern for world problems has faded away from systems literature. Why? What was the nature of what for Churchman and other scholars of his rime was an obvious link? How can there be such a thing as ""world issues"" or ""world problems""? This is the first article of a trilogy devoted to find a way through those questions. In this first article, initial questioning opens a path of thinking that reveals how modern systems thinking is inseparable from world issues. At the beginning of such a path, Richard Rorty's provocative call to forget about that 5/6 of the world population that cannot be saved is found. Rorty claims that the modern question ""what are we?""-which is at the basis of the concern with world problems-has been replaced, in the last 50 years, by the question ""who are we?""-which leads to the pragmatical question ""Who can be saved?"" This in turn means a dramatic change in our moral way of thinking and acting.","Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn, Ctr Interpret Systemol, Merida, Venezuela","Fuenmayor, R (reprint author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn, Ctr Interpret Systemol, Merida, Venezuela.",,,,,,"Ackoff R, 1974, REDESIGNING FUTURE; Checkland P.

Early approaches employing systems ideas, such as operational research, systems analysis and systems engineering, were suitable for tackling certain well-defined problems, but were found to have limitations when faced with complex problems involving people with a variety of viewpoints and frequently at odds with one another. Systems thinkers responded with approaches such as system dynamics and organisational cybernetics to tackle complexity; soft systems methodology (SSM) and interactive planning to handle subjectivity; and critical systems heuristics to help the disadvantaged in situations involving conflict. There was a corresponding enlargement of the range of problem contexts in which they felt competent to intervene. It has been critical systems thinking, however, which has supplied the bigger picture, has allowed systems thinking to mature as a discipline and has set out how the variety of methodologies now available can be used together in a coherent manner to promote successful intervention in complex societal problem situations. This paper outlines, at the request of the editor of this special issue, my involvement in developing critical systems thinking and practice, describes its origins, nature and use, and sets out a programme for future research in the area.

This land attack mission requires large numbers of precision guided munitions to be delivered to aim points hundreds of miles inland, Navy long-range concept evaluations have identified electromagnetic launch as a technology with an excellent chance of affordably delivering these massed competent munitions. Preliminary studies have verified the feasibility of fulfilling this mission requirement with an electromagnetic (EM) gun, These same studies also amplified the need for the navy to articulate its operational requirements to the gun system designer so that a definitive engineering trade space study can be undertaken. This paper will outline a systems engineering approach to the land attack fleet whose major subsystems are: the targets, the targeting sensors, land attack missiles, carrier aviation, close in weapons systems, Ehl gun projectiles, the Ehl guns, the pulsed power system, the power distribution system, and the ships. Taking this fleet-level view identifies the operational role of the EM gun and the high leverage relationships between the operational, architectural and engineering trade space parameters. Identifying these roles and relationships will serve to facilitate the dialog between the naval fleet operator, the naval architect, and the electromagnetic gun engineer in an effort to identify tradeoffs that have a significant detrimental impact on gun development while incurring only minor penalties in operational capability.","Naval Operat Strateg Studies Grp, Newport, RI 02841 USA","Stumborg, MF (reprint author), Naval Operat Strateg Studies Grp, Newport, RI 02841 USA.",,,,,,"Walls WA, 1999, IEEE T MAGN, V35, P262, DOI 10.1109/20.738414; BEBAR M, 1999, UNPUB COMMUNICATION; CASTELLI C, 1999, INSIDE NAVY     1115; *CHIEF NAV OP, 1999, STRAT STUD GROUP 18; DENT P, 1991, DTRCSD9105; GALLAGHER D, UNPUB SCENARIO BASED; GILMER T, 1982, INTRO NAVAL ARCHITEC; *J HOPK U APPL PHY, 1998, SURF COMB LAND ATT W; LAW E, 1998, THESIS NAVAL POSTGRA; MCNAB IR, 1999, I ADV TECH PUB, V367; MCVETY P, 2000, P NAVAL I, V126, P88; TURMAN B, UNPUB PRELIMINARY AS; ZIMM A, 1997, MODELING MANEUVER WA",13,2,2,0,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9464,,,IEEE T MAGN,IEEE Trans.

To discuss a potentially powerful approach to safer medication administration on the hospital ward, based on principles of safety developed in other high-risk industries, and consistent with recent national reports on safety in health care released in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). To discuss why punitive approaches to safety on the hospital ward and in the nursing literature do not work. Background. Drug administration error on the hospital ward is an ever-present problem and its occurrence is too frequent. Administering medication is probably the highest-risk task a nurse can perform, and accidents can lead to devastating consequences for the patient and for the nurse's career. Drug errors in nursing are often dealt with by unsystematic, punitive, and ineffective means, with little knowledge of the factors influencing error generation. Typically, individual nurses are simply blamed for their carelessness. By focusing on the individual, the complete set of contributing factors cannot be known. Instead, vain attempts will be made to change human behaviour - one of the most change-resistant aspects of any system. A punitive, person-centred approach therefore, severely hampers effective improvements in safety. By contrast, in other high-risk industries, such as aviation and nuclear power, the systems-centred approach to error reduction is routine. Conclusions. Accidents or errors are only the tip of the incident iceberg. Through effective, nonpunitive incident reporting, which includes reports of near-misses and system problems in addition to actual accidents, the systems-approach allows the complete set of contributing factors underlying an accident to be understood and addressed. Feedback to participants and targeted improvement in the workplace is also important to demonstrate that incident data are being used appropriately, and to maintain high levels of on-going reporting and enthusiasm for the scheme. Drug administration error is a serious problem, which warrants a well-reasoned approach to its improvement.","Green Lane Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia, Auckland, New Zealand; Univ Auckland, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Auckland, New Zealand","Anderson, DJ (reprint author), Green Lane Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia, Private Bag 92189, Auckland, New Zealand.",,,"Webster, Craig/0000-0002-6997-4263",,,"CULLEN DJ, 1995, JOINT COMM J QUAL IM, V21, P541; Beckmann U, 1996, ANAESTH INTENS CARE, V24, P311; Meurier CE, 2000, J ADV NURS, V32, P202; BATES DW, 1995, J GEN INTERN MED, V10, P199, DOI 10.1007/BF02600255; Bates DW, 1997, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V277, P307, DOI 10.1001/jama.277.4.307; HART GK, 1994, ANAESTH INTENS CARE, V22, P556; Merry AF, 1996, ANAESTHESIA, V51, P987, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2044.1996.tb14974.x; Reason J, 2000, BRIT MED J, V320, P768, DOI 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.768; RUNCIMAN WB, 1993, ANAESTH INTENS CARE, V21, P506; WEBB RK, 1993, ANAESTH INTENS CARE, V21, P520; Bates DW, 1996, DRUG SAFETY, V15, P303; BERWICK DM, 1989, NEW ENGL J MED, V320, P53, DOI 10.1056/NEJM198901053200110; Callaghan S, 1990, Nurs Times, V86, P36; Carlisle D, 1996, Nurs Times, V92, P29; Clayton M, 1987, RN, V50, P30; COHEN MR, 1990, NURSING 90, V20, P23; COOPER MC, 1995, J ADV NURS, V21, P487, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2648.1995.tb02731.x; COUSINS D, 1999, PHARM PRACTICE, V9, P220; Davis L, 1997, Oncol Nurs Forum, V24, P641; Department of Health, 2000, ORG MEM REP EXP GROU; FOLEY J, 1999, CLIN LETT NURSE PRAC, V3; FOLEY J, 1999, CLIN LETT NURSE PRAC, V4; GALLETLY DC, 1991, ANAESTH INTENS CARE, V19, P66; GLADSTONE J, 1995, J ADV NURS, V22, P628, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22040628.x; HUNT P, 1988, PERFUSION, V3, P83, DOI 10.1177/026765918800300203; Kohn LT, 1999, ERR IS HUMAN BUILDIN; KRITCHEVSKY SB, 1991, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V266, P1817, DOI 10.1001/jama.266.13.1817; Leape LL, 2000, BRIT MED J, V320, P725, DOI 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.725; Maurino D.

An effective planning for the basin's environmental management system is desired for sustainable regional development In this study, an environmental system dynamics model, named ErhaiSD, is developed for supporting this planning task. The ErhaiSD consists of dynamic simulation models that explicitly consider information feedback that governs interactions in the system. Such models are capable of synthesizing component-level knowledge into system behaviour simulation at an integrated level. This capability is very useful in analyzing and recommending policy decisions. For the study case, interactions among a umber of system components within a time frame of 15 years are examined dynamically. Four planning alternatives are considered. The base run is based on an assumption that the existing pattern of human activities will prevail in the entire planning horizon, and the other alternatives are based on previous planning studies. The contributions of various nonpoint pollution sources to the lake's eutrophication problems, and the effects of industrial activities and wastewater treatment processes on pollution problems in the Xier River are analyzed through the developed modeling system. The exercise draws attention to the implications of different alternatives to the system's environmental and socio-economic objectives. The modeling results are directly useful for simulating and evaluating a variety of decision actions and their dynamic consequences, and answering questions such as 'What should I do?', 'What if I do?' and 'What are the expected consequences?'.

Many complex processes exhibit behaviour that changes over time and space. Such properties demand equally diverse sensing modalities. A process tomography system able to exploit multiple sensor modes must permit the integration of their data, probably centred upon a composite process model. The paper reviews the systems engineering and integrated design constraints. These include a range of hardware oriented challenges: the complexity and specificity of the front end electronics for each modality; the need for front end data pre-processing and packing; the need to integrate the data to facilitate data fusion; and finally the features to enable successful fusion and interpretation. A range of software aspects are also reviewed: the need to support differing front-end sensors for each modality in a generic fashion; the need to communicate with front end data pre-processing and packing systems; the need to integrate the data to allow data fusion; and finally to enable successful interpretation. The review of the system concepts is illustrated with an application to the study of a complex multi-component process.","Univ Leeds, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Inst Integrated Informat Syst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Hoyle, BS (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Inst Integrated Informat Syst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,"West, Robert/C-3834-2008; Williams, Richard/N-3398-2014","West, Robert/0000-0001-7305-3654; Williams, Richard/0000-0002-7367-5186",,,"Dickin F, 1996, MEAS SCI TECHNOL, V7, P247, DOI 10.1088/0957-0233/7/3/005; Yang WQ, 1999, IEE P-SCI MEAS TECH, V146, P47, DOI 10.1049/ip-smt:19990008; BROWN BH, 1992, Patent No. 9201156; Hoyle BS, 1996, MEAS SCI TECHNOL, V7, P272, DOI 10.1088/0957-0233/7/3/007; WANG M, 1997, Patent No. 0749285; WEST RM, 1999, VIRT CTR IND PROC TO, P195; XIE CG, 1992, IEE PROC-G, V139, P89; Yang M, 1999, IEEE T ULTRASON FERR, V46, P492, DOI 10.1109/58.764834",8,0,0,0,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3853-7,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2001,4188,,,,,,191,200,,10.1117/12.417164,,10,Automation & Control Systems; Optics,Automation & Control Systems; Optics,BS18T,WOS:000169001300020,B,"Sitaula, BK; Sankhayan, PL; Singh, BR; Hofstad, O; Gurung, NR",,"Ascough, JC; Flanagan, DC",,"Sitaula, BK; Sankhayan, PL; Singh, BR; Hofstad, O; Gurung, NR",,,Soil erosion in Himalayan watershed: A modelling based system analysis of soil and forest degradation,"SOIL EROSION RESEARCH FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, PROCEEDINGS",,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Soil Erosion Research for the 21st Century,"JAN 03-05, 2001","HONOLULU, HI",Amer Soc Agr Engineers,,crown cover; degradation; Nepal; soil erosion; watershed,,"Forest degradation, manifested through decline in forest cover, and the resulting soil erosion losses, are a serious problem caused by a complex coupling of bio physical, socio-economic and technological factors in the Himalayan watersheds.

The main object of study is duality gap bounds in quadratic programming which deals with problems of maximizing quadratic functionals subject to quadratic constraints. Such optimization is known to be universal, in the sense that many computationally hard questions can be reduced to quadratic programming. On the other hand, it is conjectured that an efficient algorithm of solving general non-convex quadratic programs exactly does not exist. A specific technique of ""relaxation"", which essentially replaces deterministic decision parameters by random variables, is known experimentally to yield high quality approximate solutions in some non-convex quadratic programs arising in engineering applications. However, proving good error bounds for a particular relaxation scheme is usually a challenging mathematical problem. In this paper relaxation techniques of dynamical system analysis will be described. It will be shown how operator theoretic methods can be used to give error bounds for these techniques or to provide counterexamples. On the other hand, it will be demonstrated that some difficult problems of operator theory have equivalent formulations in terms of relaxation bounds in quadratic programming, and can be approached using the insights from combinatorics and system theory.","MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Megretski, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 35-415, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,"ALIZADEH F, 1995, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V5, P13, DOI 10.1137/0805002; Toker O, 1998, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V43, P409, DOI 10.1109/9.661609; Pisier G, 1997, J AM MATH SOC, V10, P351, DOI 10.1090/S0894-0347-97-00227-0; Goemans MX, 1995, J ACM, V42, P1115, DOI 10.1145/227683.227684; HALMOS PR, 1970, B AM MATH SOC, V76, P887, DOI 10.1090/S0002-9904-1970-12502-2; Megretski A, 1997, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V42, P819, DOI 10.1109/9.587335; KRIVINE JL, 1979, ADV MATH, V31, P16, DOI 10.1016/0001-8708(79)90017-3; HASTAD J, 1997, P 29 ACM S THEOR COM; NESTEROV Y., 1997, QUALITY SEMIDEFINITE; Nesterov Y.

We use a two parameter approximation scheme to linearize their exact non-linear general-relativistic equations for magneto-hydrodynamic evolution. Using a two-fluid approach we set up the governing equations as a fourth order autonomous dynamical system. Analysis of the equilibrium points for the radiation dominated era lead to solutions similar to the super-horizon modes found analytically by Tsagas and Maartens. We find that a study of the dynamical system in the dust-dominated era leads naturally to a magnetic critical length scale closely related to the Jeans length. Depending on the size of wavelengths relative to this scale, these solutions show three distinct behaviors: large-scale stable growing modes, intermediate decaying modes, and small-scale damped oscillatory solutions.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Hobbs, S (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",stacey@maths.uct.ac.za; peter@vishnu.mth.uct.ac.za,,,,,"Barrow JD, 1997, PHYS REV LETT, V78, P3610, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.3610; Maartens R, 1997, PHYS REV D, V55, P463, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.463; Jedamzik K, 1998, PHYS REV D, V57, P3264, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.57.3264; ELLIS GFR, 1989, PHYS REV D, V40, P1804, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.40.1804; EHLERS J, 1989, MON NOT R ASTRON SOC, V238, P503; Tsagas CG, 1998, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V15, P3523, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/15/11/016; ELLIS GFR, 1990, PHYS REV D, V42, P1035, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.42.1035; Tsagas CG, 1997, CLASSICAL QUANT GRAV, V14, P2539, DOI 10.1088/0264-9381/14/9/011; Adams J, 1996, PHYS LETT B, V388, P253, DOI 10.1016/S0370-2693(96)01171-9; Barrow JD, 1997, PHYS REV D, V55, P7451, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.7451; Tsagas CG, 2000, PHYS REV D, V61, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.61.083519; TAYLOR GB, 1993, ASTROPHYS J, V416, P554, DOI 10.1086/173257; DUNSBY PKS, 1992, ASTROPHYS J, V395, P54, DOI 10.1086/171630; STOEGER WR, 1995, ASTROPHYS J, V443, P1, DOI 10.1086/175496; Kim EJ, 1996, ASTROPHYS J, V468, P28, DOI 10.1086/177667; BATTANER E, 2000, ASTROPH0003370; Battaner E, 1997, ASTRON ASTROPHYS, V326, P13; BOLTON JG, 1957, ASTROPHYS J, V125, P296, DOI 10.1086/146305; BRUNI M, 1993, PHYS REV D, V47, P738, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.738; BRUNI M, 1994, MON NOT R ASTRON SOC, V270, P630; Ellis GFR, 1999, NATO ADV SCI I C-MAT, V541, P1; KRONBERG PP, 1994, REP PROG PHYS, V57, P325, DOI 10.1088/0034-4885/57/4/001; KRONBERG PP, 1995, NATURE, V374, P404, DOI 10.1038/374404a0; NILSSON U, 1998, THESIS STOCKHOLM U; Padmanabhan T., 1993, STRUCTURE FORMATION; RUZMAIKI.TV, 1971, SOV ASTRON, V14, P963; Subramanian K, 1998, PHYS REV D, V58; TSAGAS CG, 1998, THESIS SUSSEX U; Wainwright J., 1997, DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS CO; WASSERMAN I, 1978, ASTROPHYS J, V224, P337, DOI 10.1086/156381; WIELEBINSKI R, 1990, ASTROPHYS SPACE SC L, V161, P349; WOSZCZYNA A, 1992, PHYS REV D, V45, P1982, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.45.1982; ZELDOVIC.YB, 1970, SOV ASTRON, V13, P608",33,6,6,1,1,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",1550-7998,,,PHYS REV D,Phys.

The authors manipulated the type of visual display, the control system dynamics, and the frequency of the sinusoidal input signal to examine couplings with various phases between the visual signal and control movements. Analyses of the system output amplitude ratio and relative phase showed that participants (N = 24) performed poorly with 90 degrees relative phase coupling. All the couplings became less stable as the movement frequency increased. The authors developed an adaptive oscillator model with linear damping to describe the coupled system consisting of the human performer, the visual display, and the control system dynamics.

Engineering systems are represented as either complete or incomplete systems of events and as compounds of various subsystems of events. The event oriented system analysis investigates important subsystems in engineering systems, such as operational modes and failure modes and their interrelations. The analysis is also applicable to engineering systems with various relations among the sets of events, such as mutually exclusive and inclusive sets. Further, the systems and subsystems are subjected to probability and uncertainty analysis. The system uncertainty analysis is based on entropy. General relations among the probability, uncertainty of the system and uncertainties of the subsystems are derived by using information theory. Specific mathematical aspects and available methods in the uncertainty modelling of systems and subsystems are summarised. Numerical examples confirm the relevance of the event oriented system analysis and indicate potential improvements in system design. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To relate electrical changes directly to behavior, the snails were first trained and the neural changes recorded at multiple sites in reduced preparations made from the same animals. Changes in neural activity following conditioning could be recorded at the level of motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons and modulatory neurons. Of significant interest was recent work showing that neural correlates of long-term memory could be recorded in the feeding network following single-trial appetitive chemical conditioning. Available information on the synaptic connectivity and transmitter content of identified neurons within the Lymnaea circuits will allow further work on the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.","Univ Sussex, Sussex Ctr Neurosci, Sch Biol Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Benjamin, PR (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sussex Ctr Neurosci, Sch Biol Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",,,"Milner B, 1998, NEURON, V20, P445, DOI 10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80987-3; ALEXANDER J, 1984, J NEUROBIOL, V15, P67, DOI 10.1002/neu.480150107; ELLIOTT CJH, 1992, PHILOS T ROY SOC B, V336, P167, DOI 10.1098/rstb.1992.0054; MCCROHAN CR, 1980, J EXP BIOL, V85, P169; Spencer GE, 1999, J NEUROSCI, V19, P1836; Kojima S, 1996, ZOOL SCI, V13, P803, DOI 10.2108/zsj.13.803; KEMENES G, 1989, BRAIN RES, V489, P163, DOI 10.1016/0006-8993(89)90019-X; CROW TJ, 1980, SCIENCE, V209, P412, DOI 10.1126/science.209.4454.412; Lukowiak K, 1998, J EXP BIOL, V201, P877; Lukowiak K, 1996, J EXP BIOL, V199, P683; KEMENES G, 1994, BEHAV NEURAL BIOL, V61, P139, DOI 10.1016/S0163-1047(05)80067-6; Korneev SA, 1999, J NEUROSCI, V19, P7711; Lisberger SG, 1998, CELL, V92, P701, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81397-5; Svoboda K, 1997, NATURE, V385, P161, DOI 10.1038/385161a0; AUDESIRK TE, 1982, BEHAV NEURAL BIOL, V36, P379, DOI 10.1016/S0163-1047(82)90782-8; SYED NI, 1991, J COMP PHYSIOL A, V169, P557; Park JH, 1998, J NEUROSCI, V18, P5463; Staras K, 1998, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V79, P3030; BENJAMIN PR, 1981, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A, V70, P293, DOI 10.1016/0300-9629(81)90182-1; Whelan HA, 1996, J MOLLUS STUD, V62, P483, DOI 10.1093/mollus/62.4.483; Wolpaw JR, 1997, TRENDS NEUROSCI, V20, P588, DOI 10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01133-8; Hammer M, 1997, TRENDS NEUROSCI, V20, P245, DOI 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)01019-3; Kemenes G, 1997, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V78, P2351; Kojima S, 1997, NEUROSCI LETT, V230, P179, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3940(97)00507-7; Staras K, 1999, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V81, P1261; SANTAMA N, 1994, J COMP NEUROL, V342, P352, DOI 10.1002/cne.903420304; SYED NI, 1991, J EXP BIOL, V158, P37; HAWKINS RD, 1983, SCIENCE, V219, P400, DOI 10.1126/science.6294833; YEOMAN MS, 1993, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V70, P37; Benjamin P.

Therefore it would be very useful to have modeling approaches capable to adjust the model parameters according to the system dynamics. Aiming at this objective, a knowledge base model is proposed, implemented as a generalized fuzzy Petri net model. This model called AFPNM (Anticipatory Fuzzy Petri Net Model). has both the features of a fuzzy Petri net and the learning ability of a neural network. After being trained, an AFPNM can be used as a model for dynamic knowledge representation and inference related to the anticipatory system.","Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Ctr Instrumentat Res, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Lara-Rosano, F (reprint author), Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Ctr Instrumentat Res, Apartado 70-418, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,"CAO TH, 1995, J INTELL FUZZY SYST, V3, P3; SCARPELLI H, 1994, FUZZY SET SYST, V64, P175, DOI 10.1016/0165-0114(94)90332-8; BUGARIN AJ, 1994, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V2, P135, DOI 10.1109/91.277962; Yeung DS, 1998, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V28, P149, DOI 10.1109/3468.661144; YEUNG DS, 1994, EXPERT SYST APPL, V7, P281, DOI 10.1016/0957-4174(94)90044-2; Scarpelli H, 1996, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V4, P282, DOI 10.1109/91.531771; Hanna MM, 1996, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V26, P638, DOI 10.1109/3468.531910; Axelrod R., 1976, STRUCTURE DECISION C; Chaudhury A., 1993, IEEE EXPERT      APR, P79; CHEN S, 1990, SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE, V2, P3; Dubois D., 1992, HYPERINCURSIVITY NEW; DUBOIS DM, 1997, AIP C P, V437, P3; Hagan MT, 1996, NEURAL NETWORK DESIG; Jeffrey J, 1996, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V8, P241, DOI 10.1109/69.494164; KANE J, 1972, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC, V4, P129, DOI 10.1016/0040-1625(72)90010-8; Konar A, 1996, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V8, P96, DOI 10.1109/69.485639; KOSKO B, 1986, INT J MAN MACH STUD, V24, P65, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7373(86)80040-2; LARAROSANO F, 1995, ADV SYSTEMS STUDIES, V2, P22; LARAROSANO F, 1994, ADV COGNITIVE ENG KN, P98; LARAROSANO F, 1992, NASA C PUBLICATIONS, V1011, P304; LARAROSANO F, 1989, ADV COMPUTER SCI, P32; LARAROSANO F, 1996, ADV ARTIFICIAL INTEL, V3, P125; Looney C.

The effects of mosaic detector arrays upon systems performance and the optimum system design will also be discussed. This analysis allows optical fabrication tolerances to be determined during the design phase of a program, frequently resulting in substantial cost and schedule savings.

This criticism is seen to have four interpretations and each is addressed from the perspectives of social theory and systems science. Firstly, system dynamics is shown to offer not prophecies but Popperian predictions. Secondly, it is shown to involve the view that system structure only partially, not fully, determines human behaviour. Thirdly, the field's assumptions are shown not to constitute a grand content theory - though its structural theory and its attachment to the notion of causality in social systems are acknowledged. Finally, system dynamics is shown to be significantly different from systems engineering. The paper concludes that such confusions have arisen partially because of limited communication at the theoretical level from within the system dynamics community but also because of imperfect command of the available literature on the part of external commentators. Improved communication on theoretical issues is encouraged, though it is observed that system dynamics will continue to justify its assumptions primarily from the point of view of practical problem solving. The answer to the question in the paper's title is therefore: on balance, no.

The dynamical systems approach in general is to model a phenomenon that is presented by a single time series record and approximate the dynamical property (e.g. heart rate fluctuations) of a system based only on information contained in a single-variable (arterial blood pressure) of the system. The time-series data of the arterial blood pressure was reconstructed in 3-dimensional space to draw characteristic orbits. Since the reconstructed orbits of the blood pressure should retain information contained in the pressure signals, we attempted to derive instantaneous heart rate (IHR) from the reconstructed orbits. The derived IHR presenting HR fluctuations coincided well with the IHR obtained conventionally from the peak-to-peak time intervals of the maximum blood pressure. Movements of the reconstructed orbits of the arterial blood pressure in 3-dimensional space reflected HR fluctuations (i.e. transient decelerations and accelerations). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

The resulting models, either as Generalized Mass Action or as S-systems models, allow one to characterize the target system and to simulate its dynamical behavior in response to external perturbations and parameter changes. The power-law formalism was first derived as a Taylor series approximation in logarithmic space for kinetic rate-laws. The especial characteristics of this approximation produce an extremely useful systemic representation that allows a complete system characterization. Furthermore, their parameters have a precise interpretation as local sensitivities of each of the individual processes and as rate-constants. This facilitates a qualitative discussion and a quantitative estimation of their possible values in relation to the kinetic properties. Following this interpretation, parameter estimation is also possible by relating the systemic behavior to the underlying processes. Without leaving the general formalism, in this paper we suggest deriving the power-law representation in an alternative way that uses least-squares minimization. The resulting power-law mimics the target rate-law in a wider range of concentration values than the classical power-law. Although the implications of this alternative approach remain to be established, our results show that the predicted steady-state using the least-squares power-law is closest to the actual steady-state of the target system.

It is at this level where business value, as defined by the discounted value of future free cash flow is both created and destroyed.

This paper discusses the books and people, conferences and institutes, and politics and technology that have influenced the systems movement. The schools of thought presented are general systems theory, the systems approach, operations research, system dynamics, learning organizations, total quality management, and cybernetics. Three points-of-view within cybernetics are discussed. Total quality management is a new addition to the list, but we feel it is appropriate because of its extensive use of systems ideas.

Furthermore, this approach operates in an environment that involves all critical parties: child/adolescent, family-unit, physician and allied health professionals. SYSTEMS THINKING APPROACH: The objective is to bring together all key stakeholders and consider the interrelationships among them as a common process. In a managed care setting, this may be accomplished by optimizing the contributions of care delivery, health promotion and information systems. SETTING: A not-for-profit, community governed Managed Care Organization (MCO) in the Midwestern United States. Telephone-based, centralized services facilitate a process of access, communication, documentation and intervention implementation. STUDIES:Two case studies are presented as examples of how access is obtained, the intervention is tailored to individual needs, communication is established, documentation is organized and long-term support is facilitated. CONCLUSIONS: A systems thinking approach to obesity prevention and treatment in youth has great potential. In a MCO setting, such an approach may be implemented, since integrated health care delivery systems may allow a common process to be established that can bring together all key stakeholders.","HealthPartners, Ctr Hlth Promot, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA","Pronk, NP (reprint author), HealthPartners, Ctr Hlth Promot, 8100 34th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA.",,,,,,"EPSTEIN LH, 1994, HEALTH PSYCHOL, V13, P373, DOI 10.1037/0278-6133.13.5.373; STUNKARD A, 1967, AM J PSYCHIAT, V123, P1296; TROIANO RP, 1995, ARCH PEDIAT ADOL MED, V149, P1085; GUO SS, 1994, AM J CLIN NUTR, V59, P810; PROCHASKA JO, 1982, PSYCHOTHER-THEOR RES, V19, P276, DOI 10.1037/h0088437; GIDDING SS, 1995, J PEDIATR-US, V127, P868, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3476(95)70020-X; DIETZ WH, 1984, AM J CLIN NUTR, V39, P619; SERDULA MK, 1993, PREV MED, V22, P167, DOI 10.1006/pmed.1993.1014; FLETCHER SW, 1992, ANN INTERN MED, V116, P942; FOREYT JP, 1994, APPL PREV PSYCHOL, V3, P209, DOI 10.1016/S0962-1849(05)80095-2; FOREYT JP, 1995, AM ACAD KINESIOL PHY, V7, P264; LEIBEL RL, 1993, CRIT REV FOOD SCI, V33, P351; O'Connor P J, 1997, J Ambul Care Manage, V20, P17; Pronk N P, 1997, J Ambul Care Manage, V20, P24; Pronk N P, 1997, HMO Pract, V11, P43; PRONK NP, 1998, BEST PRACTICES MED M, P55; Senge P.

Tradeoffs such as spectral and spatial resolution, telescope and spectrometer temperature, aperture, f/No., integration time, optics and filter transmissions, and so forth can be quickly changed to evaluate changes to the signal/noise ratio or other performance metrics. An alternative use of such models is to identify promising instrument proposals for further study. A series of models were constructed to evaluate general instrument designs as an illustration of this process. These models included two grating spectrometers (whiskbroom and pushbroom) and a spatially modulated interferometer. All were given a common set of radiometric inputs and telescope optical prescription. Results of the modeling illustrate the performance differences between instrument types, although signal/noise predictions should be evaluated along with other parameters such as manufacturability, precision of calibration, and so forth. Such modeling allows instrument developers to demonstrate to potential customers improvements in their instruments, and the advantages of their product over other instruments for a specific application. Ifa common set of inputs is used for the different instrument models, this technique gives customers one metric with which to evaluate the disparate proposals.","Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 90041 USA","Pavri, B (reprint author), Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 90041 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-2994-5,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999,3533,,,,,,15,24,,10.1117/12.336866,,10,Environmental Sciences; Instruments & Instrumentation; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics,BM42U,WOS:000078691100003,S,"Fathi-Torbaghan, M; Hildebrand, L",,"Priddy, KL; Keller, PE; Fogel, DB; Bezdek, JC",,"Fathi-Torbaghan, M; Hildebrand, L",,,Complex system analysis using CI-methods,APPLICATIONS AND SCIENCE OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE II,PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE),,English,Proceedings Paper,Conference on Applications and Science of Computational Intelligence II,"APR 05-08, 1999","ORLANDO, FL",SPIE - Int Soc Opt Engn,,,,"Modern technical tasks often need the use of complex system models. In many complex cases the model parameters can be gained using neural networks, but these systems allow only a one-way simulation from the input values to the learned output values. If evaluation in the other direction is needed, these models allow no direct evaluation. This task can be solved using evolutionary algorithms, which are part of the computational intelligence. The term computational intelligence covers three special fields of the artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. We will focus only on the topic of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic. Evolutionary algorithms covers the fields of genetic algorithms, evolution strategies and evolutionary programming. These methods can be used to optimize technical problems. Evolutionary algorithms have certain advantages, if these problems have no mathematical properties, like steadiness or the possibility to obtain the derivatives. Fuzzy logic systems normally lack these properties. The use of a combination of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic allow an evaluation of the learned simulation models in the direction form output to the input values. An example can be given from the field of screw rotor design.","Univ Dortmund, Dept Comp Sci, Chair 1, D-44227 Dortmund 50, Germany","Fathi-Torbaghan, M (reprint author), Univ Dortmund, Dept Comp Sci, Chair 1, Otto Hahn Str 16, D-44227 Dortmund 50, Germany.",,,,,,"ATHI M, 1995, IEEE INT C EV COMP P; ATHI M, 1994, EVOLUTION STRATEGIES; BACK T, 1992, EVOLUTIONARY ALGORIT; Dubois D., 1993, FUZZY SETS INTELLIGE; FATHI M, 1993, P 1I WORLD C INT FED; FATHI M, 1997, IEEE T SYSTEM MAN B, V27; Goldberg D.E., 1989, GENETIC ALGORITHMS S; HILDEBRAND L, 1995, 316 COLL RES CTR; Holland J.H., 1975, ADAPTION NATURAL ART; Kandel A., 1992, FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEMS; Rechenberg I., 1973, EVOLUTIONSSTRATEGIE; Schwefel H.

Writers bemoaning the intransigence of the mental health system tend to focus on a small analytical level, only to find themselves mired in the rationalities of the existing system. Problems are acknowledged to be system-wide, yet few writers have used a method of analysis appropriate for systemic problems. Drawing upon the General System Theory (GST) analytical perspective, this article advances a systematic approach to understand the mental health system and to facilitate the development of reform strategies that recognize the system's complexity and changing nature. The article first discusses the failure of major reform efforts in the mental health system and the limitations of mainstream analysis of mental health politics and policies with respect to the objectives of analysis and reform. This article describes how systems thinking has thus far influenced the study of the mental health policy and politics system, and argues that a systemic perspective is profitable for reconceiving the mental health system, enabling a fresh basis for the development of reform strategies. The mental health system should be seen as a social system influenced by larger political and economic dimensions, not just as a 'delivery system' scientifically constructed by neutral experts. Furthermore, the policy planning process should be viewed as part and parcel of a mental health system modeled as complex and dynamic. The systemic perspective outlined here should help both to clarify the value-based objectives that we hold for the system and, consequently, to plan for the strategic reforms that have so far eluded us.","Univ Montreal, Ecole Serv Social, Grp Rech Aspects Sociaux Sante & Prevent, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",,,,,,,"ACKOFF RL, 1974, LONG RANGE PLANN, V7, P2, DOI 10.1016/0024-6301(74)90127-7;

This reductionist approach is doomed to failure in complex electromagnetic environments. The ultimate objective of EC is to affect the man, preferably the decision maker, and not the individual system(s) per Se. In modern conflict, any model of the prevalent EC environment also depends on non-quantifiable factors ,such as training, morale and the uncertainties of combat, which contribute to system entropy and emphasize the importance of the human decision maker. The EC subsystem of a (CW)-W-2 system can therefore be classified as a Human Activity System (HAS). The authors propose a holistic system design philosophy for EC systems, based on the System Dynamics (SD) approach, incorporating the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), to achieve a realistic representation of the futuristic electromagnetic environment The SSM-SD paradigm is systematically developed using the CATWOE model system Root Definition (RD), cybernetic holons and System Dynamics archetypes.","IAT, Pune 411025, Maharashtra, India","Debnath, R (reprint author), IAT, Girinagar, Pune 411025, Maharashtra, India.",,,,,,"Fitts R.

Four steps are necessary for controlling the carded web and its uniformity. First, a good design-based model of the plant needs to be considered. Second, a good actuator, sensor and, controller that are also realizable must exist. Third, input to the controller must be constructed using knowledge of the system's dynamic response to improve system performance. Finally, all the effort of the design is meaningful only when tested by experiment. This paper presents a complete strategy for a uniform carded fiber web control system. Part I illustrates the system dynamics, stability, controllability, and observability by application to feedback control of one worker-stripper group, and uses the root-locus design technique for the controller design. At the same time, a complementary control scheme for precise system control is presented. This composite control method gives the corresponding closed-loop system not only a time-optimal operation, but also the most efficient, precise control properties.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Text Engn, Intelligent Control & Simulat Lab, Taipei, Taiwan","Kuo, CFJ (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Text Engn, Intelligent Control & Simulat Lab, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,"LAM J, 1990, INT J CONTROL, V52, P989, DOI 10.1080/00207179008953578; FRANKLIN GF, 1991, FEEDBACK CONTROL DYN; FRIENDLAND B, 1986, CONTROL SYSTEM DESIG; GROSBERG P, 1991, J TEXT I, V82, P457, DOI 10.1080/00405009108659232; GROSBERG P, 1992, J TEXT I, V83, P380, DOI 10.1080/00405009208631211; GROSBERG P, 1992, J TEXT I, V83, P375, DOI 10.1080/00405009208631210; GUTIERREZ H, 1993, THESIS N CAROLINA ST; GUTIERREZ HM, 1995, TEXT RES J, V65, P638, DOI 10.1177/004051759506501103; Hwang C, 1995, J CHIN INST ENG, V18, P889; KO C, 1992, Patent No. 2380031; KUO BC, 1991, AUTOMATIC CONTROL SY, P615; LAM J, 1993, INT J CONTROL, V57, P377, DOI 10.1080/00207179308934394; RUST JP, 1994, TEXT RES J, V64, P573, DOI 10.1177/004051759406401004; SINGET N, 1980, ASME, V112, P76; Smith O.

By the early 1990's, this research raised challenges to the 'conventional wisdom' regarding these materials. It was during this time period that the Structural Materials research group at the Materials Directorate constructed a research approach to these materials based upon a systems engineering analysis of alloy technology development. This approach contributed to the emergent successes of these materials and will play an important part in our development of new alloy systems. The approach incorporates analytical, computational and experimental research, over numerous material length and time scales, in parallel efforts. In so doing, the approach intrinsically couples science and engineering, lending insight into 'best paths' for engineering development. The integration of such knowledge forms the basis for the most relevant scientific inquiry, and efficient alloy technology development. This manuscript briefly summarizes some impacts of fundamental research on gamma alloys within our systems approach. A variety of scientific and engineering challenges remain to be solved, some of which are discussed. The findings may serve as a framework for future development efforts for other intermetallic systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

One of the new functions the society asks to the domestic herbivores is to maintain or improve the biodiversity of both plant and animal communities and the integrity of pastoral landscape as well. However, a shortage of basic knowledge characterizes the relationships between grazing activities and vegetation especially at landscape level. Grazing of vegetation by domestic herbivores is a complex hierarchical ecological process. It involves different levels of organization either in the case of free ranging animals or when feeding and spatial behaviour of grazing animals is under human control. In this paper we propose theoretical and methodological elements to help answering two important questions to improve the understanding of the relationships between grazing activity, landscape patterns and biodiversity. 1)How changes in land use management with grazing animals influence landscape patterns? 2) To which extent changes in grazing practices affect ecological characteristics of vegetation (disturbance, stability, and reversibility) ? Our skills are in the field of system analysis applied to ecology with special reference to hierarchy theory. organization of biological system theory and landscape ecology.

Our analysis focused on the metabolic pathway starting at asparaginic acid proceeding to isoleucine, methionine and lysine. The rate of change in the concentration of the biochemical species was expressed as 21 linear rate equations. We obtained the rate constants and the magnitude of feedback from reported experimental data. Linear systems analysis revealed that the metabolic system under study was stable but uncontrollable. These properties were insensitive to changes in the magnitude of feedback. To show the effect of optimizing the feedback so that it minimizes the square of the concentration of the species and the control input, we analyzed the impulse response of the species, transient response and the singular value of the system for four cases; (1) at the physiological state without optimizing the feedback, (2) at the physiological state attained after optimizing the feedback, (3) at the pathophysiogical state attained with enzyme deficiency states for lysine and methionine metabolism without optimizing the feedback, and (4) at the pathophysiological state attained after optimizing the feedback for enzyme deficiencies. In the enzyme deficient model, the impulse response oscillated and lasted longer than that in the physiological state. These changes appeared even in the species on other branched pathways. The singular value was elevated in the enzyme deficient state. By optimizing the feedback, all the impulse responses in the enzyme deficient state recovered to nearly those in the normal physiological state. Similarly, the transient response and the singular value in the enzyme deficient state recovered to nearly the normal physiological values. We elucidated the numerical value of the feedback gain for this optimization. The present analysis is useful for the evaluation of the integrated properties of amino acid metabolism and the optimization technique is potentially of use for determining a treatment course for congenital metabolic enzyme deficiencies.

Such classification would then lead to those that are hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, etc. There is at least one mycotoxin that affects each system in the animal body as a direct or indirect mechanism of toxicity. Several important mycotoxins affect the same system, for example the immune system. Also, a given mycotoxin may affect several systems concurrently. During the past 30 plus years that mycotoxins have been studied, we have come to more fully understand some of the metabolic attributes influencing toxicity. Until the discovery of the fumonisins, we understood little about sphingolipid metabolism nor did we understand the possible relationship of sphingolipid metabolism to carcinogenesis. The systems approach to categorize the mycotoxins was much simpler when we viewed a mycotoxicosis on a gross scale following rather large dose regimens. This becomes more difficult when we now are more easily assessing subcellular and molecular responses following low dose regimens. The interrelatedness of the systems becomes more obvious with our increased understanding of the mode of action of the mycotoxins and it becomes more difficult to separate, for example, the immune system responses from those of perhaps the endocrine system. In this regard, we are beginning to understand the action of certain mycotoxins in host-parasite interactions in plants and also the involvement of mycotoxins in disease, whether it be plant or animal.","USDA ARS, Natl Ctr Agr Utilizat Res, Peoria, IL 61604 USA","Richard, JL (reprint author), USDA ARS, Natl Ctr Agr Utilizat Res, 1815 N Univ St, Peoria, IL 61604 USA.",,,,,,"WANG E, 1991, J BIOL CHEM, V266, P14486; DOERR JA, 1974, POULTRY SCI, V53, P1728; LARSON BT, 1995, J ANIM SCI, V73, P1396; PORTER JK, 1995, J ANIM SCI, V73, P871; ROTTINGHAUS GE, 1991, J AGR FOOD CHEM, V39, P112, DOI 10.1021/jf00001a022; COLE RJ, 1983, J AGR FOOD CHEM, V31, P655, DOI 10.1021/jf00117a045; Hidy P H, 1977, Adv Appl Microbiol, V22, P59, DOI 10.1016/S0065-2164(08)70160-6; MARQUARDT RR, 1992, J ANIM SCI, V70, P3968; SABBIONI G, 1987, CARCINOGENESIS, V8, P819, DOI 10.1093/carcin/8.6.819; MARASAS WFO, 1988, ONDERSTEPOORT J VET, V55, P197; KNAUS HG, 1994, BIOCHEMISTRY-US, V33, P5819, DOI 10.1021/bi00185a021; FARNWORTH ER, 1983, CAN J ANIM SCI, V63, P967; GYONGYOSSYISSA MIC, 1986, FOOD CHEM TOXICOL, V24, P311, DOI 10.1016/0278-6915(86)90008-6; BACON CW, 1986, AGRON J, V78, P106; GELDERBLOM WCA, 1992, MYCOPATHOLOGIA, V117, P11, DOI 10.1007/BF00497273; SEGAL R, 1983, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V70, P343, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(83)90152-7; WOGAN GN, 1967, CANCER RES, V27, P2370; LOVELESS AR, 1967, T BRIT MYCOL SOC, V50, P15; TUNG HT, 1975, POULTRY SCI, V54, P1962; RICHARD JL, 1981, MYCOPATHOLOGIA, V76, P55, DOI 10.1007/BF00761899; PESTKA JJ, 1989, FOOD CHEM TOXICOL, V27, P361, DOI 10.1016/0278-6915(89)90141-5; PACE JG, 1985, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V80, P377, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(85)90382-5; ARP LH, 1981, MYCOPATHOLOGIA, V73, P109, DOI 10.1007/BF00562600; ARP LH, 1979, J AM VET MED ASSOC, V175, P565; AUST SD, 1969, BIOCHEM PHARMACOL, V18, P929, DOI 10.1016/0006-2952(69)90066-5; Aust S.

The major advance consists in a spectral 3D representation of LMA and tremor, which provides a better selectivity than previous systems. This behavioral processing indicated that tremor is characterized by a 7-14 Hz frequency band and LMA by a 20-35 Hz frequency band. The association of this system to the microdialysis technique to simultaneously evaluate the striatal DA level confirms that pressure-induced striatal DA increase is in great part linked to the LMA, and supports the concept of a complex ethiology for this symptom. We conclude that this new behavioral system analysis associated with microdialysis study constitutes a powerful tool to investigate the role of different neurotransmitters in the occurrence of the behavioral components described in the HPNS of rats.

In many cases, enteral administration of these peptides via the gastrointestinal tract is preferred. However, oral administration of peptides and proteins is often limited by their instability in the gastrointestinal environment and/or poor absorption from the gut. To promote the absorption of these drugs, we first discovered unsaturated fatty acids with absorption enhancing activities and less harmful properties to the gastrointestinal membranes in hydrolysates of natural oil. The mechanisms whereby the permeability of drugs was enhanced by the fatty acids are associated with the disorder in the membrane's interior and the interaction of these fatty acids with the polar head group of phospholipid. Furthermore, we suggested that a SH-related substance was involved in the permeability enhancing effect of these fatty acids. Secondly, we developed a lympho-targeting delivery system for bleomycin by the combined effects of an ion-pair complex with dextran sulfate (DS) and an absorption enhancer. We found a very high lymphatic concentration when administered bleomycin-DS together with the absorption enhancer. Its mechanism may be due to a molecular sieving in the blood-lymph barrier in the intestinal tissues. Finally, to improve the intestinal absorption of peptides, we synthesized novel lipophilic derivatives of peptides including TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone), tetragastrin, enkephalin, calcitonin and insulin by a chemical modification with fatty acids, while maintaining their pharmacological activities.

The study consists of two principal parts: an experimental determination of the nonlinearities inherent in piezoelectric actuators using different control strategies and an analysis of how those nonlinearities would affect the stability and performance of feedback control systems that utilize piezoelectric actuators. The voltage control response of the piezoelectric actuator tested was demonstrably more nonlinear than the same actuator with charge feedback circuitry. Nyquist design analysis reveals that these nonlinearities translate into lower stability margins and potential system performance for voltage control of piezoelectric actuators as compared to charge control. The improved system stability that can be achieved with charge control as compared to voltage control is demonstrated to be significant in multi-degree-of-freedom systems but almost negligible when the system dynamics are essentially single degree of freedom.,"VANDERBILT UNIV,NASHVILLE,TN 37235",,,,,,,"ANDERSON EH, 1990, P AIAA ASME ASCE AHS, P2221; MAIN JA, 1995, J GUID CONTROL DYNAM, V18, P1068, DOI 10.2514/3.21506; NEWCOMB CV, 1982, ELECTRON LETT, V18, P442, DOI 10.1049/el:19820301; Jones L., 1994, Smart Materials and Structures, V3, DOI 10.1088/0964-1726/3/2/010; [Anonymous], 1988, 1761987 ANSIIEEE; KAIZUKA H, 1988, JPN J APPL PHYS 2, V27, pL773, DOI 10.1143/JJAP.27.L773; Comstock R.

However, suitability of a particular management technology for a farm cannot be determined by crop, soil and weather factors alone. Resource constraints cannot be determined at the field scale, and neither can risks to the economic or nutritional well-being of the household. Systems approaches at the farm scale must take account of biophysical characteristics such as soil, weather, crops and animals, characteristics of the farm and the farm household, and the social, economic, political and ecological environment of the farm. To make significant advances in farm-scale systems analysis, a 'bottom-up' approach is required. Three levels of analysis provide a practical framework for future efforts. The unconstrained production level relies on enterprise simulation and simple budgeting models to aggregate farm production, estimate profit and compute the resources required to manage a farm in a particular way. The resource-constrained production level considers internal farm constraints in assessing what the farm with its existing limitations can attain. At the adaptive production level, a farm decision model considers the characteristics and preferences of the farm household These three levels of farm system analysis parallel levels of analysis at the field scale that continue to provide guidance in the development and use of crop models. This framework may lead to more generic farm-scale models, definitions of minimum data sets for their use and wider application of systems approaches at the farm scale.",,"Jones, JW (reprint author), UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT AGR & BIOL ENGN,POB 110570,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.",,,,,,,0,21,21,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-4285-2,SYST APPR S,,,1997,5,,,,,,1,18,,,,18,Agronomy,Agriculture,BH23V,WOS:A1997BH23V00001,J,"Hong, HM; Leung, CY; Lu, FF; Sun, TP",,,,"Hong, HM; Leung, CY; Lu, FF; Sun, TP",,,Thermal imager primary design and analysis using PC based scientific spreadsheet,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,primary system design; primary system analysis; thermal imager; performance model; scientific spreadsheet,,"Effective primary design can avoid over-specification that will cause waste on cost.

The concern for public safety and the theft of valuable assets are being discussed at all levels of government and throughout the public sector. There is a growing demand for security systems that can adequately safeguard people and valuable assets against the sophistication of those criminals or adversaries who pose a threat. The crime in this country has been estimated at $70 billion in direct costs and up to $300 billion in indirect costs. Health insurance fraud alone is estimated to cost American businesses $100 billion. Theft, warranty fraud, and counterfeiting of computer hardware totaled $3 billion in 1994. A threat analysis is a prerequisite to any security system design to assess the vulnerabilities with respect to the anticipated threat. Having established a comprehensive definition of the threat, crime prevention, detection, and threat assessment technologies can be used to address these criminal activities. This talk will outline the process used to design a security system regardless of the level of security. This methodology has been applied to many applications including: government high security facilities residential and commercial intrusion detection and assessment anti-counterfeiting/fraud detection technologies (counterfeit currency, cellular phone billing, credit card fraud, health care fraud, passport, green cards, and questionable documents) industrial espionage detection and prevention (intellectual property, computer chips, etc.) security barrier technology (creation of delay such as gates, vaults, etc.).",,"Steele, BJ (reprint author), SANDIA NATL LABS,POB 5800,MS 0768,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87185, USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,SPIE - INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010",,,0-8194-2336-X,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1997,2934,,,,,,112,115,,10.1117/12.265404,,4,"Criminology & Penology; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Law; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Optics",Criminology & Penology; Engineering; Government & Law; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,BH14V,WOS:A1997BH14V00015,J,"Huang, BJ; Chuang, MD",,,,"Huang, BJ; Chuang, MD",,,System design of orifice pulse-tube refrigerator using linear flow network analysis,CRYOGENICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,pulse-tube refrigerator; cryocooler; system analysis,THERMOACOUSTIC HEAT TRANSPORTATION; ENERGY TRANSFORMATION; EXPERIMENTAL-VERIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; CRYOGENICS; MODEL,"A linear flow network model was developed for the system analysis of an orifice pulse-tube refrigerator (OPT). The flow network analysis considers the pressure as the electric voltage and the mass flow as the electric current. The linear governing equations for the flow network are derived from the continuity and the momentum equations and are analytically solved simultaneously with the energy equation derived to account for the thermal effect in the flow network. The thermal performance calculation can thus be greatly simplified by solving the equivalent circuit of the OPT using a sinusoidal signal analysis. To minimize the analytical errors, an equivalent pulse tube temperature (T) over bar(ptm) was introduced with a weighting factor W-F which was determined experimentally.

Several theoretical and practical shortcomings (problems) of these methods are identified: (i) the PU method is not in full accordance with both formalisms and terminology inherent to distribution practice, i.e. the PU method 'is not complete'; (ii) applications of both the P% and SU methods are not suitable for elaboration of power system issues; (iii) application of the PU method is not suitable for calculation of the most complex power system (quasi)steady states treated in the sequence domain. These shortcomings are a sufficient reason for redefinition of standard scaling methods. The redefinition is performed in two steps: (i) standard scaling methods are extended, redefined and synthesised by a new (generalised) scaling concept; (ii) this concept is generalised for elaboration of power system models in the sequence domain. The above mentioned three problems are solved by the new scaling concept. This concept seems to be a definitive solution of the scaling problem in the analysis of the AC power system (quasi) steady states. In addition to these states, models of power system dynamics are encompassed by the new scaling concept in a usual way. This concept is demonstrated by several representative examples.",,"Strezoski, VC (reprint author), UNIV NOVI SAD,SCH ENGN SCI,INST POWER & ELECT ENGN,FRUSKOGORSKA 11,YU-21000 NOVI SAD,YUGOSLAVIA.",,,,,,"ALVARADO FL, 1985, IEEE T POWER AP SYST, V104, P1109, DOI 10.1109/TPAS.1985.323462; Anderson PM, 1973, ANAL FAULTED POWER S; Arnold CP, 1983, COMPUTER MODELING EL; Bergen A., 1986, POWER SYSTEM ANAL; GONNEN T, 1986, ELECT POWER DISTRIBU; GROSS CA, 1992, IEEE T POWER SYST, V7, P702, DOI 10.1109/59.141776; GUIILE AE, 1977, ELECT POWER SYSTEMS; *IEEE INC, 1980, AM NAT STAND IEEE RE; Lakervi E, 1989, ELECT DISTRIBUTION N; REED MB, 1969, IEEE T POWER AP SYST, VPA88, P1665, DOI 10.1109/TPAS.1969.292374; ROY L, 1982, IEEE T POWER AP SYST, V101, P2738, DOI 10.1109/TPAS.1982.317645; Stevenson W.D., 1975, ELEMENTS POWER SYSTE; STREZOSKI VC, 1991, IEEE T POWER SYST, V6, P1493, DOI 10.1109/59.116995; *WEST EL CORP, 1965, DISTR SYST",14,4,4,0,1,IEE-INST ELEC ENG,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD, ENGLAND SG1 2AY",1350-2360,,,IEE P-GENER TRANSM D,IEE Proc.-Gener.

This method allows estimation of the mean transit time through the lungs and calculation of the volume of distribution of alfentanil in the lungs. In the first part of the study the pulmonary distribution of alfentanil was studied in six anesthetized pigs during three hemodynamic states (control, partial clamping of the inferior vena cave, and complete clamping of the right pulmonary artery). In the second part of the study the pulmonary distribution of sufentanil was studied in 10 patients, scheduled for elective CABG, during and after a constant rate infusion of 10 min. Pulmonary passage of the opioids was characterized by functions of transit times, derived from the pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial concentration curves. Pulmonary distribution volumes were calculated from the mean transit time and pulmonary blood flow. Pulmonary distribution volume of alfentanil during the control measurement was significantly higher (486+/-88 ml) than during either partial caval clamping (346+/-89 ml, p < 0.05) or right pulmonary artery clamping (336+/-56 ml, p < 0.05). There was no change in the extravascular volume of distribution of alfentanil with each hemodynamic stale. Pulmonary volume of distribution of sufentanil in the patients was 22.6 (10.9) L. Pulmonary distribution of opioids can be studied using system dynamics analysis, both after bolus injection and during and after infusion. This method can be used for periods beyond the initial passage of the drug through the lungs.","UNIV HOSP GOTTINGEN,DEPT ANAESTHESIOL REANIMAT & CRIT CARE,D-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY; UNIV LEIDEN HOSP,DEPT CLIN CHEM,NL-2300 RC LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","Boer, F (reprint author), UNIV LEIDEN HOSP,DEPT ANAESTHESIOL,POB 9600,NL-2300 RC LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,"ZIERLER KL, 1962, CIRC RES, V10, P393; BOCK J, 1987, THORAC CARDIOV SURG, V35, P53, DOI 10.1055/s-2007-1020196; BERTLER A, 1978, ACTA ANAESTH SCAND, V22, P530; BOCK J, 1987, BIOMED TECH, V32, P241, DOI 10.1515/bmte.1987.32.10.241; BOCK JC, 1990, J SURG RES, V48, P254, DOI 10.1016/0022-4804(90)90222-N; BOCK J C, 1990, Biomedical Instrumentation and Technology, V24, P42; BOCK JC, 1988, MED INSTRUM, V22, P20; BOER F, 1994, BRIT J ANAESTH, V73, P458, DOI 10.1093/bja/73.4.458; BOER F, 1992, BRIT J ANAESTH, V68, P370, DOI 10.1093/bja/68.4.370; DAVIS ME, 1979, DRUG METAB DISPOS, V7, P425; GEDDES DM, 1979, THORAX, V34, P810, DOI 10.1136/thx.34.6.810; GORESKY CA, 1978, MICROVASC RES, V14, P149; HOEFT A, 1991, BRIT J ANAESTH, V66, P73, DOI 10.1093/bja/66.1.73; IRESTEDT L, 1978, ACTA ANAESTH SCAND, V22, P413; JORFELDT L, 1983, ACTA ANAESTH SCAND, V27, P5; KIRK BW, 1969, J APPL PHYSIOL, V27, P607; KNOPP TJ, 1969, J APPL PHYSIOL, V27, P36; MASERI A, 1970, CIRC RES, V26, P527; PANG JA, 1982, J APPL PHYSIOL, V52, P393; PERSSON MP, 1988, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V25, P235; RATCLIFFE FM, 1989, EUR J CLIN PHARMACOL, V37, P537, DOI 10.1007/BF00558140; ROERIG DL, 1989, ANESTH ANALG, V69, P461; ROERIG DL, 1987, ANESTHESIOLOGY, V67, P466, DOI 10.1097/00000542-198710000-00004; ROERIG DL, 1989, ANESTHESIOLOGY, V71, P62, DOI 10.1097/00000542-198907000-00012; ROTH RA, 1982, AM J PHYSIOL, V242, pH844; ROTHSTEIN P, 1987, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V240, P410; STOW RW, 1954, J APPL PHYSIOL, V7, P161; TAEGER K, 1988, BRIT J ANAESTH, V61, P425, DOI 10.1093/bja/61.4.425; VANROSSUM JM, 1989, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V17, P365; WATKINS CA, 1987, ANESTHESIOLOGY, V67, P916, DOI 10.1097/00000542-198712000-00007; ZAR JH, 1984, BIOSTAT ANAL, P175",31,8,8,1,1,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0090-466X,,,J PHARMACOKINET BIOP,J.

Nutrient management systems commonly concentrate on maximizing yields rather than attempting to balance the needs of the crop with the desire to minimize contamination of the environment. Particular problems are shown to be associated with utilization of animal manures on arable crops, and the move towards soil conservation practices, especially the use of cover crops. We suggest that nutrient budgets provide a suitable format for developing a systems approach. We consider the issues associated with managing nitrogen for whole farm systems, taking account of the need for efficient production and protection of the environment from losses by leaching and in gaseous form.

When time-variant pharmacodynamics are observed, a specific model for tolerance or sensitization is required. However, with single dosing, hysteresis that results from a time-variant biophase concentration-effect relationship cannot be distinguished from hysteresis caused by dispositional delays. This can lead to the inappropriate minimization of hysteresis. As an approach to this problem, simulated and real kinetic-dynamic data were analyzed with the pharmacodynamic system analysis program ATTRACT. The use of a multiple dosing regimen and this hysteresis minimization algorithm resulted in a simple diagnostic test to distinguish between dispositional effects of acute tolerance and sensitization.","GEORGETOWN UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PHARMACOL,TOXICOL & APPL PHARMACOKINET PROGRAM,WASHINGTON,DC 20007",,,,,,,"HOLFORD NHG, 1981, CLIN PHARMACOKINET, V6, P429; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1993, J PHARM SCI, V82, P266, DOI 10.1002/jps.2600820310; BENOWITZ NL, 1988, ICSU S SERIES, V9; Gibaldi M, 1982, PHARMACOKINETICS; PORCHET HC, 1987, J CLIN INVEST, V80, P1466, DOI 10.1172/JCI113227; PORCHET HC, 1988, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V244, P231; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1992, J PHARM SCI, V81, P925, DOI 10.1002/jps.2600810918",7,5,5,0,0,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0724-8741,,,PHARMACEUT RES,Pharm.

The latest development is an optimized prototype with a total volume of about 11 liters which consists of a main animal tank (Zoological Component) with integrated bacteria filter, a semibiological coarse filter, an illuminated higher plant container (Botanical Component) and combined small animal and electrode compartment. A silastic tubing gas exchanger in a closed side-loop serves as an emergency unit in case of the malfunction of the Botanical Component and the water is driven through the system by rotatory pumps. It is operative for several weeks in closed state. This C.E.B.A.S. Mini-Module also represents an aquatic artificial ecosystem in which basic scientific problems of component interactions and system theory can be solved with the side aspects of combined production of animal and plant food in bioregenerative life support systems. The paper presents details of the current statuts of the hardware development and data about the function of the fully biological life support of the system, e. g. mid-term registrations of water parameters. Moreover, morphological and pysiological data of the experimental animals (-the teleost fish Xiphophorus helleri-) and plants (-a tropical Ceratophyllum species-) demonstrate the biological stability of the system. These are used to elaborate first details of population interactions and interdependencies as a basis of a disposed comprehensive system analysis which is the essential precondition for the design of possible aquatic modules for bioregenerative life support systems.",,"BLUM, V (reprint author), RUHR UNIV BOCHUM,FAC BIOL,CTR EXCELLENCE,CEBAS,W-4630 BOCHUM 1,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,12,13,1,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0094-5765,,,ACTA ASTRONAUT,Acta Astronaut.,JUL,1994,33,,,,,,167,177,,10.1016/0094-5765(94)90122-8,,11,"Engineering, Aerospace",Engineering,PJ372,WOS:A1994PJ37200023,11539518J,"PALOMBIT, R",,,,"PALOMBIT, R",,,DYNAMIC PAIR BONDS IN HYLOBATIDS - IMPLICATIONS REGARDING MONOGAMOUS SOCIAL-SYSTEMS,BEHAVIOUR,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BEHAVIOR; CHINA; ORGANIZATION; CONCOLOR; GIBBON; SYNDACTYLUS; CALLICEBUS; ECOLOGY; SAIMIRI; BIRDS,"Descriptions of monogamy in the gibbons (Hylobates spp., Hylobatidae) have generally emphasized features derived from inference rather than direct observation: 1) adults male for life; 2) the genetic structure of groups corresponds with a ''nuclear family'' pattern of parents and their mutual offspring; 3) first mate acquisition is achieved when two newly dispersed, unaccompanied, young adults of opposite sex establish a new pair and territory together. The six-year history of mating associations of adults in three groups of sympatric, wild siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) and three groups of white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) at the Ketambe Research Station (Sumatra, Indonesia) challenge the generality of these assumptions. These longitudinal sociodemographic data suggest that gibbon pair bonds are not necessarily life-long and that adults may leave mates permanently or temporarily, sometimes in order to exploit new reproductive opportunities. Of 11 heterosexual pair bonds that existed at some time during the study, only two were terminated by death of one adult, whereas five were terminated when one adult left its current male. In some cases, the ''deserting'' individual left its mate and joined a neighboring adult of opposite sex who had recently lost its own mate through death or desertion. This turnover in pair bond membership generated stable, ''non-nuclear'' family groups in which the replacement mate was not the parent of the resident nonadults. Mechanisms of mate acquistion observed at Ketambe included two processes that may also promote non-nuclear families. A young adult may obtain its first mate by: 1) replacing an adult of the same sex in a neighboring group or in the group in which it resides; 2) establishing a new pair bond (and territory) with another unmated young adult of opposite sex who is, however, accompanied in dispersal by juvenile conspecifics from its group. Finally, observed extra-pair copulations (in siamang) suggested an additional, but as yet unspecified potential for variable relatedness between adult males and resident nonadults. Review of other long-term historics of pair bonds in wild gibbons and of studies of socio-sexual behavior in captivity reinforce the conclusion that the apparent temporal stability and underlying behavioral inflexibility of pair bonds has been over-emphasized. Although data on behavior and reproduction are limited, they nevertheless suggest strongly that the mating and social systems of these monogamous primates are considerably more dynamic and complex than previously appreciated.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,ANIM BEHAV GRP,DAVIS,CA 95616",,,,,,,"AGREN G, 1989, ANIM BEHAV, V37, P11, DOI 10.1016/0003-3472(89)90002-X; AGREN G, 1984, ANIM BEHAV, V32, P528, DOI 10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80291-2; ALDRICHB.FP, 1973, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V38, P631, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.1330380279; ANDERSON CM, 1983, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V60, P15, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.1330600104; MOCK DW, 1990, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V5, P39, DOI 10.1016/0169-5347(90)90045-F; LAZARUS J, 1990, ANIM BEHAV, V39, P672, DOI 10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80378-1; TILSON RL, 1981, FOLIA PRIMATOL, V35, P259, DOI 10.1159/000155979; VANSCHAIK CP, 1985, BIOTROPICA, V17, P196, DOI 10.2307/2388217; CUBICCIOTTI DD, 1978, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V3, P311, DOI 10.1007/BF00296316; TENAZA RR, 1975, FOLIA PRIMATOL, V24, P60, DOI 10.1159/000155685; ANZENBERGER G, 1986, AM J PRIMATOL, V11, P37, DOI 10.1002/ajp.1350110105; WICKLER W, 1980, Z TIERPSYCHOL, V52, P201; BLEISCH WV, 1991, PRIMATES, V32, P539, DOI 10.1007/BF02381946; FREED LA, 1987, AM NAT, V130, P507, DOI 10.1086/284728; RAEMAEKERS JJ, 1984, BEHAVIOUR, V91, P146, DOI 10.1163/156853984X00263; CARTER CS, 1986, ADV STUD BEHAV, V16, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60189-8; BARASH DP, 1981, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V9, P187, DOI 10.1007/BF00302936; Bennett E.L., 1983, Malayan Nature Journal, V36, P187; BERKSON G, 1969, 2ND P INT C PRIM ATL, V1, P43; BERKSON G, 1969, LAB ANIM CARE, V19, P808; BIRDSALL DA, 1973, EVOLUTION, V27, P106, DOI 10.2307/2407124; Birkhead T.R., 1988, Advances in the Study of Behavior, V18, P35; BIRKHEAD TR, 1986, BEHAVIOUR, V101, P101; BREZNOCK AW, 1977, LAB ANIM SCI, V27, P222; Brockelman W.Y., 1984, P298; BROCKELM.WY, 1973, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V38, P637, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.1330380280; Brockelman WY, 1974, GIBBON SIAMANG, V3, P137; CARPENTER C.

The general systems models of an open thermodynamic system have been obtained in this paper. These models are the non-integrable open system and the non-ergodic open system. These models are obtained by presenting the open system dynamics as unpredictable evolution. Evolution in both models is set as an autonomous action which is the observable projection of the open system dynamics. Unpredictability is presented as ambiguity in the case of the non-integrable open system, and as indeterminacy-in the case of the non-ergodic open system. It has been shown that the unpredictable evolution determines an encoding for the non-integrable open system, and a monochromatic subgraph-for the non-ergodic open system. The redundancy and entropy for both models have been introduced by using these combinatorial mechanisms. The application of the two open system models in artificial intelligence and in the functional diagnostics of dynamic systems has been discussed.",,"STEFANOV, SZ (reprint author), TECHENERGO COMBINE 14,KOZLODUI STR,BU-1202 SOFIA,BULGARIA.",,,,,,"Aigner M, 1979, COMBINATORIAL THEORY; ARBIB MA, 1969, AUTOMATICA, V5, P589, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(69)90026-0; BANCRJI RB, 1982, P IEEE, V70, P1428; BRUCK J, 1988, INT J INTELL SYST, V3, P59, DOI 10.1002/int.4550030106; CHOW EY, 1984, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V29, P603, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1984.1103593; Kalman R.

A combined experimental/theoretical approach is outlined for realizing a biologically based representation of the hippocampal formation. The approach involves developing two models, one a ''nonparametric'' model in which the subsystems, principal neurons, and subcellular processes of the principal neurons are characterized experimentally using random impulse train stimulation. Non-linearities in the input/output relation are represented as the kernels of a functional power series. Using multidimensional z-transforms, a procedure is demonstrated for deriving kernel functions for interneurons that are not directly observable. A scheme is proposed for developing an ''external'' model of the hippocampus, in which the system is represented as the composite of the input/output functions of its intrinsic elements. The second model is an ''internal'' model, derived from an n-level field theory, in which specific cellular and subcellular processes are included as the parameters of coupled field equations describing the dynamics at a different hierarchical levels of nervous system function. The current model consists of two field equations for each of the synaptic and neuronal levels, respectively,- included in each are geometrical relations to incorporate anatomical characteristics (eg., connectivity patterns, synaptic, and cell densities) of the system. It is proposed that the two models be used in a complementary manner to achieve an understanding of the neurobiological basis of the system dynamics, and thus the mnemonic function, of the hippocampus.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT NEUROL SURG,PITTSBURGH,PA 15260; UNIV SO CALIF,PROGRAM NEUROSCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089; UNIV ANGERS,INST THEORET BIOL,ANGERS,FRANCE; UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT ELECT ENGN,PITTSBURGH,PA 15260","BERGER, TW (reprint author), UNIV SO CALIF,DEPT BIOMED ENGN,401 HEDCO NEUROSCI BLDG,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089, USA.",,,,,,"ALGER BE, 1982, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V328, P125; AMARAL DG, 1989, NEUROSCIENCE, V31, P571, DOI 10.1016/0306-4522(89)90424-7; Andersen P., 1975, HIPPOCAMPUS, P155; SCHARFMAN HE, 1991, J NEUROSCI, V11, P1660; MCNAUGHTON BL, 1983, EXP BRAIN RES, V52, P41; YECKEL MF, 1990, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V87, P5832, DOI 10.1073/pnas.87.15.5832; GAARSKJAER FB, 1978, J COMP NEUROL, V178, P49, DOI 10.1002/cne.901780104; STEWARD O, 1976, J COMP NEUROL, V167, P285, DOI 10.1002/cne.901670303; SPRUSTON N, 1992, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V67, P508; LEE YW, 1965, INT J CONTROL, V2, P237, DOI 10.1080/00207176508905543; LOMO T, 1971, EXP BRAIN RES, V12, P46; LOMO T, 1971, EXP BRAIN RES, V12, P18; SCHARFMAN HE, 1990, NEUROSCIENCE, V37, P693, DOI 10.1016/0306-4522(90)90100-I; BROWN TH, 1990, ANNU REV NEUROSCI, V13, P475, DOI 10.1146/annurev.neuro.13.1.475; BARKER JL, 1987, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V386, P485; FOSTER TC, 1989, SCIENCE, V244, P1580, DOI 10.1126/science.2740902; WILSON M, 1992, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V67, P981; ANDERSEN P, 1971, EXP BRAIN RES, V13, P208; STRUBLE RG, 1978, BRAIN RES, V152, P580, DOI 10.1016/0006-8993(78)91113-7; AMBROSINGERSON J, 1990, SCIENCE, V247, P1344, DOI 10.1126/science.2315702; RAWLINS JNP, 1985, BEHAV BRAIN SCI, V8, P479; KRAUSZ HI, 1975, BIOL CYBERN, V19, P217, DOI 10.1007/BF00334442; WIENER SI, 1989, J NEUROSCI, V9, P2737; MCNAUGHTON BL, 1993, ANNU REV PHYSIOL, V55, P375, DOI 10.1146/annurev.physiol.55.1.375; ANDERSEN P, 1971, EXP BRAIN RES, V13, P222; BERGER TW, 1988, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V60, P1095; EICHENBAUM H, 1987, J NEUROSCI, V7, P716; TRAUB RD, 1991, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V66, P635; EICHENBAUM H, 1992, J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI, V4, P217, DOI 10.1162/jocn.1992.4.3.217; ZADOR A, 1990, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V87, P6718, DOI 10.1073/pnas.87.17.6718; MCNAUGHTON BL, 1977, J COMP NEUROL, V175, P439, DOI 10.1002/cne.901750404; BERGER TW, 1981, BRAIN RES, V215, P329, DOI 10.1016/0006-8993(81)90512-6; GROSSBERG S, 1992, COGNITIVE BRAIN RES, V1, P3, DOI 10.1016/0926-6410(92)90003-A; WILSON MA, 1993, SCIENCE, V261, P1055, DOI 10.1126/science.8351520; BERGER TW, 1983, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V50, P1197; BRADLER JE, 1989, SYNAPSE, V4, P132, DOI 10.1002/syn.890040207; CHAUVET GA, 1993, J MATH BIOL, V31, P771, DOI 10.1007/BF00168045; ZOLAMORGAN S, 1986, J NEUROSCI, V6, P2950; TEYLER TJ, 1986, BEHAV NEUROSCI, V100, P147, DOI 10.1037/0735-7044.100.2.147; BUZSAKI G, 1981, BRAIN RES, V230, P346, DOI 10.1016/0006-8993(81)90413-3; COHEN NJ, 1980, SCIENCE, V210, P207, DOI 10.1126/science.7414331; EICHENBAUM H, 1989, J NEUROSCI, V9, P2764; FOSTER TC, 1987, BRAIN RES, V408, P86, DOI 10.1016/0006-8993(87)90361-1; GROSSBERG S, 1989, NEURAL NETWORKS, V2, P79, DOI 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90026-9; SWANSON LW, 1978, J COMP NEUROL, V181, P681, DOI 10.1002/cne.901810402; OKEEFE J, 1976, EXP NEUROL, V51, P78, DOI 10.1016/0014-4886(76)90055-8; MULLER RU, 1987, J NEUROSCI, V7, P1935; SLOVITER RS, 1987, J COMP NEUROL, V256, P42, DOI 10.1002/cne.902560105; DUDEK SM, 1992, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V89, P4363, DOI 10.1073/pnas.89.10.4363; DAVIS S, 1992, J NEUROSCI, V12, P21; HAMPSON RE, 1993, BEHAV NEUROSCI, V107, P715, DOI 10.1037//0735-7044.107.5.715; AMARAL DG, 1978, J COMP NEUROL, V182, P851, DOI 10.1002/cne.901820508; RIBAK CE, 1983, J NEUROCYTOL, V12, P577, DOI 10.1007/BF01181525; de No RL, 1934, J PSYCHOL NEUROL, V46, P113; BERGER TW, 1984, SCIENCE, V224, P627, DOI 10.1126/science.6324350; BLISS TVP, 1973, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V232, P331; CHAUVET GA, 1993, J MATH BIOL, V31, P475; ZIMMER J, 1971, J COMP NEUROL, V142, P393, DOI 10.1002/cne.901420402; ZUCKER RS, 1989, ANNU REV NEUROSCI, V12, P13, DOI 10.1146/annurev.neuro.12.1.13; DOYERE V, 1992, HIPPOCAMPUS, V2, P39, DOI 10.1002/hipo.450020106; SCLABASSI RJ, 1988, ANN BIOMED ENG, V16, P17, DOI 10.1007/BF02367378; BAKST I, 1986, J NEUROSCI, V6, P1452; CHETKOVICH DM, 1991, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V88, P6467, DOI 10.1073/pnas.88.15.6467; BERGER TW, 1976, SCIENCE, V192, P483, DOI 10.1126/science.1257783; Berger T.

Our aim in this work has been to produce an efficient packing strategy that is flexible enough for a wide variety of industrial uses and which can be implemented in fast, moderately priced hardware. We have deliberately adopted a systems approach, versus a purely algorithmic one, since we are concerned with industrial vision problems in which significant problem constraints exist. The packing procedure that we devised consists of two major components. The first is a geometric packing technique that is based on morphological image processing operations. This is used in conjunction with a heuristic packing procedure. Some of the factors considered at the heuristic level include shape ordering and shape orientation, both of which must be carried out prior to applying the geometric packer. The heuristic procedure also deals with problem constraints that are specific to a given application. Various issues arising from this approach, such as the properties and performance of the procedure, are discussed within the background of some sample applications. The ideas outlined are currently being used in the development of a visually controlled intelligent packing work cell.","UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,DEPT COMP MATH,CARDIFF CF1 3NS,S GLAM,WALES","WHELAN, PF (reprint author), DUBLIN CITY UNIV,SCH ELECTR ENGN,DUBLIN,IRELAND.",,"Whelan, Paul/C-7962-2011","Whelan, Paul/0000-0001-9230-7656",,,"BISCHOFF EE, 1990, EUR J OPER RES, V44, P267, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(90)90362-F; DOWSLAND WB, 1985, NEW ZEAL OPER RES, V13, P1; BATCHELOR BG, 1991, INTELIGENT IMAGE PRO; BATCHELOR BG, 1991, P APIE, V1615, P87; CHEN CS, 1991, INT J PROD RES, V29, P1963, DOI 10.1080/00207549108948061; DREYFUS HL, 1986, MIND MACHINE, P184; FREEMAN H, 1989, MACHINE VISION INSPE, P223; GAREY MR, 1979, COMPUERS INTRACTABIL; HUDSON NR, 1989, AI COGN SCI, P3; ONG HL, 1984, OPER RES, V32, P983, DOI 10.1287/opre.32.5.983; PENROSE R, 1989, EMPERORS NEW MIND, P562; SCHNEITER JL, 1990, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V12, P775, DOI 10.1109/34.57668; STEWART I, 1991, NEW SCI         0713, P29; UHRY J, 1989, NEW METHODS OPTIMIZA, P191; WHELAN PF, 1991, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V1615, P77; Wolfson H., 1988, Annals of Operations Research, V12, DOI 10.1007/BF02186360",16,2,2,0,0,SOC PHOTO-OPT INSTRUM ENG,BELLINGHAM,"PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010",0091-3286,,,OPT ENG,Opt.

It has been observed that the oral absorption of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and other volatile organic chemicals is markedly affected by the dosing vehicle, with administration in oils producing erratic blood concentration-time profiles with multiple peaks. Analysis of this type of data by a compartmental modeling approach can be difficult, and requires numerous assumptions about the absorption processes. Alternatively, a system analysis method with few assumptions may provide a more accurate description of the observed data. In the current investigations, a nonlinear system analysis approach was applied to blood CCl4 concentration-time data obtained following iv and oral administration. The oral regimens consisted of 25 mg CCl4/kg body wt given as an aqueous emulsion, in water, as pure chemicals, and in corn oil. The system analysis procedure, based upon a disposition decomposition method, provided an absorption input rate function, F, for each regimen. A physiological pharmacokinetic model, based primarily on parameters available in the literature, and the F input functions, formed a hybrid model that adequately described the observed blood CCl4 concentration-time data. The same physiological pharmacokinetic model, employing conventional first-order absorption input schemes, did not predict the data as well. Overall, the system analysis approach allowed the oral absorption Of CCl4 to be characterized accurately, regardless of the vehicle. Though system analysis is based on general mathematical properties of a system's behavior rather than on its causal mechanisms, this work demonstrates that it can be a useful adjunct to physiological pharmacokinetic models.","UNIV GEORGIA,COLL PHARM,DEPT PHARMACEUT,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV GEORGIA,COLL PHARM,DEPT PHARMACOL & TOXICOL,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV TEXAS,COLL PHARM,DIV PHARMACEUT,AUSTIN,TX 78712",,,,,,,"ANGELO M J, 1984, Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, V4, P329, DOI 10.1016/0273-2300(84)90043-6; GARGAS ML, 1989, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V98, P87, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(89)90137-3; ANDERSEN ME, 1980, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V54, P100, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90011-3; KIM HJ, 1990, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V102, P50, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(90)90082-6; YAMAOKA K, 1978, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V6, P165, DOI 10.1007/BF01117450; KIM HJ, 1990, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V102, P34, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(90)90081-5; DALLAS CE, 1989, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V98, P385, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(89)90168-3; CUTLER DJ, 1978, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V6, P265, DOI 10.1007/BF01312266; FISHER JW, 1989, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V99, P395, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(89)90149-X; REITZ RH, 1988, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V95, P185, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(88)90155-X; RAMSEY JC, 1984, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V73, P159, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(84)90064-4; BULL RJ, 1986, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V69, P49, DOI 10.2307/3430370; BIRT DF, 1987, AM J CLIN NUTR, V45, P203; CONDIE LW, 1986, FUND APPL TOXICOL, V7, P199, DOI 10.1016/0272-0590(86)90148-X; GILLESPIE WR, 1985, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V13, P441, DOI 10.1007/BF01061479; GILLESPIE WR, 1990, PRINCIPLES ROUTE ROU, P285; GINGELL R, 1987, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V91, P386, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(87)90060-3; Linz P., 1985, ANAL NUMERICAL METHO; MERRICK BA, 1989, J APPL TOXICOL, V9, P15, DOI 10.1002/jat.2550090105; PAUSTENBACH DJ, 1988, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V96, P191, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(88)90080-4; STAATS DA, 1991, DRUG METAB DISPOS, V19, P144; UEMITSU N, 1986, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V83, P20, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(86)90319-4; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1984, J PHARM SCI, V73, P1136, DOI 10.1002/jps.2600730827; Veng-Pedersen P., 1977, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V5, P513; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1988, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V16, P413, DOI 10.1007/BF01062554; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1987, ARCH TOXICOL, V60, P355, DOI 10.1007/BF00295755; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1984, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V12, P627, DOI 10.1007/BF01059557; WELSCH CW, 1987, AM J CLIN NUTR, V45, P192; Withey J R, 1983, J Appl Toxicol, V3, P249, DOI 10.1002/jat.2550030506; WITHEY JR, 1976, J TOXICOL ENV HEALTH, V1, P381; 1986, SIMUSOLV; 1982, INTT MATH STATISTICS; 1988, EPA600688004; 1983, REPORT HOC WORKING G",34,0,0,0,0,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0090-466X,,,J PHARMACOKINET BIOP,J.

System internal volume has the opposite effect. A large internal volume can reduce periodic variations but has little effect on net pressure momentum change caused by low frequency air leaks. Air pipelines should be sized for dynamic performance and vacuum drop minimization.","UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT AGR ENGN,COLUMBIA,MO 65211; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT AGR ENGN,ST PAUL,MN 55108; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ANIM SCI,ST PAUL,MN 55108",,,,,,,"Dahl J.

Urinary NMN concentrations were determined using a new HPLC method, plasma levels by a conventional fluorescence method. At physiological levels net tubular secretion of NMN was evident due to a renal fractional excretion, i.e., a ratio of renal NMN clearance to creatinine clearance, above unity. Increasing plasma concentrations lead to an increase in the fractional excretion, indicating saturation of the underlying tubular reabsorption process. Binding to plasma proteins was excluded by ultra-filtration experiments. Clearances measured at physiological levels were about one half of the maximum renal clearance attained following the infusion. This maximum value was approximately six times the creatinine clearance and may be a useful approximation of the renal plasma flow. System analysis, including a novel method to calculate the net response following a multiple input, was used to determine the pharmacokinetic system parameters.",,"WEBER, W (reprint author), FREE UNIV BERLIN,KLINIKUM STEGLITZ,DEPT CLIN PHARMACOL,HINDENBURGDAMM 30,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY.",,,,,,"WEBER W, 1985, EUR J CLIN PHARMACOL, V28, P213, DOI 10.1007/BF00609694; CUTLER DJ, 1978, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V6, P265, DOI 10.1007/BF01312266; WEBER W, 1990, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V18, P501, DOI 10.1007/BF01073936; LUKE DR, 1990, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V48, P503; STEIMER JL, 1984, DRUG METAB REV, V15, P265, DOI 10.3109/03602538409015066; BARTELS H, 1972, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V37, P192; BESSEGHIR K, 1990, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V253, P452; Clark B R, 1980, Methods Enzymol, V66, P5; DANTZLER WH, 1986, AM J PHYSIOL, V250, pF407; DIXON WJ, 1987, BMDP BIOMEDICAL COMP; DRAPER NR, 1981, APPLIED REGRESSION A, P237; FARAH A, 1961, J PHARMACOL EXP THER, V134, P245; Fumagalli R., 1971, METABOLIC EFFECTS NI, P33; GEIGY JR, 1977, WISSENSCHAFTLICHE TA, P102; Gibaldi M, 1982, PHARMACOKINETICS, P199; IMBIMBO BP, 1988, J PHARM SCI, V77, P784, DOI 10.1002/jps.2600770914; Kassirer JP, 1988, DISEASES KIDNEY, P393; KRUGERTHIEMER E, 1977, HDB EXPT PHARM, P100; MIZUTA E, 1985, CHEM PHARM BULL, V33, P1620; PERLZWEIG WA, 1945, J BIOL CHEM, V161, P417; RENNICK BR, 1981, AM J PHYSIOL, V240, pF83; RESCIGNO A, 1986, DRUG TRACER KINETICS, P86; ROSS CR, 1975, AM J PHYSIOL, V228, P1641; SHEINER LB, 1985, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V13, P515, DOI 10.1007/BF01059333; SHIBATA K, 1988, Vitamins (Kyoto), V62, P85; SHIM CK, 1985, J PHARMACOBIO-DYNAM, V8, P20; SHIM CK, 1984, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V12, P23, DOI 10.1007/BF01063609; SOMOGYI A, 1990, ANAL BIOCHEM, V187, P160, DOI 10.1016/0003-2697(90)90435-C; VENGPEDERSEN P, 1988, J PHARMACOKINET BIOP, V16, P413, DOI 10.1007/BF01062554; ZIPORIN ZZ, 1979, METHOD ENZYMOL, V62, P86",30,5,5,0,0,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0090-466X,,,J PHARMACOKINET BIOP,J.

Technological innovations based on the propositions generated through this paradigm have played a profound role in the extraordinary productivity growth that has occurred in agriculture across the globe. Yet with recognition of its success in this context is the realization of its inadequacies from broader perspectives. There is an increasing sense of unease about degradation of biophysical environments, distortions of socio-economic environments, and dislocations of cultural environments too often associated with agricultural practices. There are calls for a new science and praxis of complexity to deal with these problematic relationships between agriculture and the environments in which it is conducted. Systems thinking and practices are emerging as useful in this regard. Two schools are apparent within this broad movement. The first (""hard"") approach comes from a pedigree that includes systems analysis, systems engineering, cybernetics, and ecosystem biology. Assuming a world of transforming systems, the ""hard"" systems scientists in agriculture seek to design new agro-ecosystems that are at once productive, stable, equitable, and sustainable. In the ""soft"" approach, with its foundation in cognitive science, the systemicity is transferred from the world to the way of investigating the world.

Traditional theories of motor development attribute changes in movement to the hierarchical maturation of the central nervous system. The dynamical systems approach emphasizes that movement self-organizes as the result of the interaction of the participating subsystems in developmental and real time. In this article, I discuss, from the theoretical perspective of the dynamical systems approach, the organization of leg movements i low- and high-risk preterm and full-term infants, developmental changes in movement in low-risk preterm infants from 34 weeks' gestational age to 40 weeks' postgestational age, and differences in movement between low-risk preterm infants at 40 weeks' postgestational age and full-term infants. Preliminary data on high-risk preterm infants are presented. Based on these data, the necessity to review and reinterpret traditional concepts of motor development is explored. Suggestions are offered and questions posed on how the dynamical systems perspective may influence the practice of physical therapy in the evaluation and treatment of infants at risk for movement dysfunction.",,"HERIZA, CB (reprint author), ST LOUIS UNIV,MED CTR,SCH ALLIED HLTH PROFESS,DEPT PHYS THERAPY,1504 S GRAND BLVD,ST LOUIS,MO 63104, USA.",,,,,,"ALS H, 1982, THEORY RES BEHAVIORA, V1, P35; AMIELTIS.C, 1968, ARCH DIS CHILD, V43, P89; THELEN E, 1983, DEV PSYCHOBIOL, V16, P29, DOI 10.1002/dev.420160105; HERIZA CB, 1988, PHYS THER, V68, P1340; DUBOWITZ LM, 1970, J PEDIATR-US, V77, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3476(70)80038-5; THELEN E, 1987, DEV REV, V7, P39, DOI 10.1016/0273-2297(87)90004-9; EASTON TA, 1972, AM SCI, V60, P591; KELSO JAS, 1979, SCIENCE, V203, P1029, DOI 10.1126/science.424729; THELEN E, 1984, INFANT BEHAV DEV, V7, P479, DOI 10.1016/S0163-6383(84)80007-7; HARRIS SR, 1987, PHYS THER, V67, P1877; Bernstein NA, 1967, COORDINATION REGULAT; Bobath K., 1966, MOTOR DEFICIT PATIEN; BRANDT J, 1980, HUMAN PHYSICAL GROWT, P139; BRAZELTON TB, 1984, NEONATAL BEHAVIORAL; CAPUTE AJ, 1982, DEV MED CHILD NEUROL, V24, P662; Capute AJ, 1978, PRIMITIVE REFLEX PRO; CLARK JE, 1988, DEV PSYCHOBIOL, V21, P445, DOI 10.1002/dev.420210504; CLARK JE, IN PRESS SENSORY MOT; Dubowitz LMS, 1981, NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSM, V79; Fiorentino M., 1981, BASIS SENSORIMOTOR D; FORSSBERG H, 1985, EXP BRAIN RES, V57, P480; Gesell A., 1954, MANUAL CHILD PSYCHOL, V2nd, P335; Haken H., 1983, SYNERGETICS; HERIZA CB, 1988, PHYS THER, V68, P1687; HERIZA CB, 1988, 1988 JOINT C AM PHYS; HERIZA CB, 1989, 64TH ANN C AM PHYS T; HERIZA CB, KINEMATIC ANAL LEG M; HERIZA CB, 1987, 53RD ANN C AM PHYS T; HERIZA CB, 1986, THESIS SO ILLINOIS U; Horowitz FD, 1987, EXPLORING DEV THEORI; KAMM K, 1991, PHYS THER, V71, P763; Kelso J.

This paper provides a framework for considering issues related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of group psychotherapeutic endeavors to benefit dually diagnosed clients. A social systems approach to psychopathology is described to illustrate how a variety of potentially treatable aspects of dysfunctioning can be identified and selected as treatment goals for group psychotherapy with mentally retarded individuals. Treatment models are presented to assist in the pragmatic blending of behavioral and psychodynamic interventions that are relevant for conducting group psychotherapy with this population. Administrators and clinicians are provided with a prototype of how to establish and maintain cost-effective linkages between mental health and mental retardation agencies, so that dually diagnosed clients are not excluded from receiving services they need. Finally, process and outcome evaluation strategies are considered which might provide an empirical basis for documenting the effectiveness of group psychotherapy as a viable, nondrug approach to treating psychopathology in mentally retarded individuals.",,"PFADT, A (reprint author), NEW YORK STATE INST BASIC RES DEV DISABILITIES,DIAGNOST & RES CLIN,1050 FOREST HILL RD,STATEN ISL,NY 10314, USA.",,,,,,"HALGIN RP, 1985, PSYCHOTHER, V22, P555, DOI 10.1037/h0085540; MATSON JL, 1983, APPL RES MENT RETARD, V4, P399, DOI 10.1016/0270-3092(83)90038-3; PAUL GL, 1967, J CONSULT PSYCHOL, V31, P109, DOI 10.1037/h0024436; STAVRAKAKI C, 1986, PSYCHIAT CLIN N AM, V9, P733; Arkowitz H., 1984, PSYCHOANALYTIC THERA; BARRETT RP, 1986, SEVERE BEHAVIOR DISO; BECK AP, 1986, PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC PR, P615; BENSON BA, 1986, J CONSULT CLIN PSYCH, V54, P728, DOI 10.1037/0022-006X.54.5.728; Benson B.A, 1986, PSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS, V5, P51; Bion W.
