However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.","[Whitehead, N.

Next, it integrates inferences from Markov processes, the Weibull distribution, and the bathtub curve analysis to develop a quantitative risk trending model. A risk factor (RF) is used to define a quantitative measure of risk. A set of failure data is applied to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of Weibull parameters that are fitted into the RF. MATLAB algorithms are used to simulate sensitivities of the RF to changes in the number of components renewed and the number admitted to or relieved from a high-operating-load regime during the life cycle. The model determines the impacts of renewal strategies on failure risk by trending risk profiles associated with these sensitivities. In addition, it provides modeling equations for the systems thinking approach which has, traditionally, used qualitative models. Furthermore, it is flexible since the computed parameters are unique to the set of data. These parameters thus generate equally unique plots of probability distribution functions that are required for analysis of reliability and risk. This is primarily intended to be used in risk management, but it can also be applied in performance-based compensation schemes for workers.","[Mkandawire, Burnet O'Brien; Ijumba, Nelson Mutatina; Saha, Akshay Kumar] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Mkandawire, Burnet O'Brien] Univ Malawi, Automobile Engn, Blantyre, Malawi; [Ijumba, Nelson Mutatina] Univ Rwanda, Acad Affairs, Kigali 4285, Rwanda","Mkandawire, BO (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",205521891@stu.ukzn.ac.za,,,University of KwaZulu-Natal's High Voltage Direct Current Centre; Centre for Postgraduate Engineering Studies of South Africa,This work was supported by the University of KwaZulu-Natal's High Voltage Direct Current Centre and Centre for Postgraduate Engineering Studies of South Africa.,"Abu-Elanien AEB, 2010, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V80, P456, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2009.10.008; Zhang X, 2011, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V81, P1709, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2011.03.018; Schneider J, 2006, INT J ELEC POWER, V28, P643, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2006.03.007; [Anonymous], 2008, 551 PAS; Mkandawire BO, 2011, IEEE SYST J, V5, P321, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2011.2148790; Endrenyi J, 1998, IEEE T POWER SYST, V13, P576, DOI 10.1109/59.667385; Bartley W.

A significant fraction of the empirical work I discuss was done by Dobzhansky and his coworkers; Goldschmidt was an astute interpreter, with strong and unusual commitments. I argue that both belong to a mechanistic tradition in genetics, concerned with the effects of chromosomal organization and systems on the inheritance patterns of species. Their different trajectories illustrate how scientists' commitments affect how they interpret new evidence and adjust to it. Dobzhansky was moved to revised views about selection, while Goldschmidt moved his attention to different genetic phenomena. However different, there are significant connections between the two that enrich our understanding of their views. I focus on two: the role of developmental considerations in Dobzhansky's thought and the role of neutrality and drift in Goldschmidt's evolutionary account. Dobzhansky's struggle with chromosomal variation is not solely about competing schools of thought within the selectionist camp, as insightfully articulated by John Beatty, but also a story of competition between selectionist thinking and developmental perspectives. In contraposition, Goldschmidt emphasized the role of low penetrance mutations that spread neutrally and pointed out that drift could result from developmental canalization. This account adds to the dominant story about Goldschmidt's resistance to the splitting of development from genetics, as told by Garland Allen and Michael Dietrich. The story I tell illustrates how developmental thinking and genetic thinking conflicted and influenced researchers with different convictions about the significance of chromosomal organization.","Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Lamm, E (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",ehudlamm@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,"Muller HJ, 1932, AM NAT, V66, P118, DOI 10.1086/280418; Sturtevant AH, 1917, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V3, P555, DOI 10.1073/pnas.3.9.555; Dobzhansky T, 1932, GENETICS, V17, P0369; Dobzhansky T, 1935, GENETICS, V20, P0366; Goldschmidt R, 1933, SCIENCE, V78, P539, DOI 10.1126/science.78.2033.539; DUBININ NP, 1945, AM NAT, V79, P570, DOI 10.1086/281297; DOBZHANSKY T, 1950, GENETICS, V35, P288; FELSENSTEIN J, 1974, GENETICS, V78, P737; BEATTY J, 1987, J HIST BIOL, V20, P289, DOI 10.1007/BF00139457; Wright S, 1941, SCI MON, V53, P165; Hall BK, 2005, J EXP ZOOL PART B, V304B, P187, DOI 10.1002/jez.b.21052; Waddington CH, 1941, NATURE, V147, P108, DOI 10.1038/147108a0; Painter TS, 1934, J HERED, V25, P465; DOBZHANSKY T, 1955, GENETICS, V40, P797; Mather K, 1943, BIOL REV CAMB PHILOS, V18, P32, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-185X.1943.tb00287.x; Goldschmidt R, 1937, NATURE, V140, P767, DOI 10.1038/140767a0; GOLDSCHMIDT RB, 1954, SCIENCE, V119, P703, DOI 10.1126/science.119.3099.703; CROW JF, 1987, J HIST BIOL, V20, P351, DOI 10.1007/BF00139460; BRNCIC D, 1954, GENETICS, V39, P77; Lamm E, 2014, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V592, P2283, DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2014.271734; DUBININ NP, 1946, GENETICS, V31, P537; IVES PT, 1947, EVOLUTION, V1, P42, DOI 10.2307/2405402; MATHER K, 1955, EVOLUTION, V9, P52, DOI 10.2307/2405357; Dietrich MR, 2000, AM ZOOL, V40, P738, DOI 10.1668/0003-1569(2000)040[0738:FHMTHE]2.0.CO;2; Dobzhansky T, 1938, GENETICS, V23, P28; Roll-Hansen N, 2009, J HIST BIOL, V42, P457, DOI 10.1007/s10739-008-9166-8; Gibson AH, 2013, J HIST BIOL, V46, P599, DOI 10.1007/s10739-012-9347-3; Roll-Hansen N, 2014, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V592, P2431, DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2014.272120; Sturtevant AH, 1938, AM NAT, V72, P447, DOI 10.1086/280797; Beatty John, 1987, PROBABILISTIC REVOLU, P271; Beatty John, 1994, P195; Carlson Elof Axel, 1966, GENE CRITICAL HIST; Carson Hampton L., 1980, EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHES; CHETVERI.S, 1961, P AM PHILOS SOC, V105, P167; Darlington Cyril Dean, 1950, ELEMENTS GENETICS; Davis Gregory, 2009, DESCENDED DARWIN INS; Dietrich Michael R., 2000, CONCEPT GENE DEV EVO, P91, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511527296.007; Dietrich Michael R., 2008, REBELS MAVERICKS HER; Dietrich MR, 2011, J HIST BIOL, V44, P693, DOI 10.1007/s10739-011-9271-y; DOBZHANSKY T, 1955, COLD SPRING HARB SYM, V20, P1; Dobzhansky T, 1962, MANKIND EVOLVING; Dobzhansky T., 1951, GENETICS ORIGIN SPEC; Dobzhansky TG, 1937, GENETICS ORIGIN SPEC; Dobzhansky T, 1943, GENETICS, V28, P162; Dobzhansky T., 1952, Heterosis., P218; Dobzhansky Th, 1953, INT UN BIOL SCI S GE, P95; Dobzhansky Theodosius, 1946, GENETICS, V31, P12; DUBININ NP, 1946, J HERED, V37, P39; Fisher R.

There have been suggestions that individual differences in self-control, willpower, impulsivity, time orientation, or more recently, thoughtfully reflective decision making (TRDM) influence choices and, ultimately, deviant outcomes. While much of the literature suggests there are differences among these concepts, they are often used interchangeably or at least noted to share common ground. Using survey data collected from university undergraduate students, this article explores the conceptual and empirical overlap and areas of distinction between key theoretical constructs. Using hypotheses derived from a dual-systems model, findings suggest impulsivity, self-control, temptation, and TRDM are distinct but interrelated constructs. Impulsivity was positively related to intentions to drink and drive in a hypothetical scenario, but temptation, self-control, and TRDM had no significant effect on intentions. Consistent with a dual-systems conceptualization, we found impulsivity and self-control work in tandem, as the risk of drinking and driving was highest for those respondents who were highly impulsive and had low self-control. Future research may seek to use a dual-system model to further reconcile trait-based and decision-based models of criminological theory.","[Mamayek, Chae; Loughran, Thomas; Paternoster, Ray] Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Mamayek, C (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 2163 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mamayekc@umd.edu,,,,,"Frederick S, 2005, J ECON PERSPECT, V19, P25, DOI 10.1257/089533005775196732; Albert D, 2011, J RES ADOLESCENCE, V21, P211, DOI 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x; Camerer CF, 2007, ECON J, V117, pC26, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02033.x; Henry B, 1996, DEV PSYCHOL, V32, P614; Reynolds B, 2006, BEHAV PHARMACOL, V17, P651, DOI 10.1097/FBP.0b013e3280115f99; Evans JST, 2013, PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI, V8, P223, DOI 10.1177/1745691612460685; BLOCK J, 1988, CHILD DEV, V59, P336, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01470.x; BECKER GS, 1968, J POLIT ECON, V76, P169, DOI 10.1086/259394; van Gelder JL, 2012, CRIMINOLOGY, V50, P637, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00276.x; Steinberg L, 2010, DEV PSYCHOBIOL, V52, P216, DOI 10.1002/dev.20445; Thomas KJ, 2013, CRIMINOLOGY, V51, P435, DOI 10.1111/1745-9125.12010; Kahneman D, 2003, AM PSYCHOL, V58, P697, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.58.9.697; Paternoster R, 2011, J QUANT CRIMINOL, V27, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10940-010-9095-5; Lynam DR, 2000, J ABNORM PSYCHOL, V109, P563, DOI 10.1037//0021-843X.109.4.563; Loewenstein G, 2008, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V59, P647, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093710; CASPI A, 1995, CHILD DEV, V66, P55, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00855.x; Rafter N, 2004, CRIMINOLOGY, V42, P979, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00542.x; Henry B, 1999, INT J BEHAV DEV, V23, P1049; Loeber R, 2012, J AM ACAD CHILD PSY, V51, P1136, DOI 10.1016/j.jaac.2012.08.019; van Gelder JL, 2014, J QUANT CRIMINOL, V30, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10940-012-9192-8; Hay C, 2001, CRIMINOLOGY, V39, P707, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2001.tb00938.x; Paternoster R, 2009, J QUANT CRIMINOL, V25, P103, DOI 10.1007/s10940-009-9065-y; Pratt TC, 2000, CRIMINOLOGY, V38, P931, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00911.x; Baumeister RF, 2002, J CONSUM RES, V28, P670, DOI 10.1086/338209; Baumeister R, 1994, LOSING CONTROL WHY P; Baumeister R.

We describe how an innovative systems analysis approach halted repeated scabies outbreaks, and highlight the importance of systems thinking for outbreaks analysis and sustaining effective infection prevention and control. Methods: Following RCA for a third successive outbreak of scabies over a 17-month period in a 60-bed respiratory care ward of a Taiwan hospital, a systems-oriented event analysis (SOEA) model was used to reanalyze the outbreak. Both approaches and the recommendations were compared. Results: No nosocomial scabies have been reported for more than 1975 days since implementation of the SOEA. Previous intervals between seeming eradication and repeat outbreaks following RCA were 270 days and 180 days. Achieving a sustainable positive resolution relied on applying systems thinking and the holistic analysis of the system, not merely looking for root causes of events. Conclusion: To improve the effectiveness of outbreaks analysis and infection control, an emphasis on systems thinking is critical, along with a practical approach to ensure its effective implementation. The SOEA model provides the necessary framework and is a viable complementary approach, or alternative, to RCA.

While significant improvements have been achieved in recent decades, the workplace accident rate remains unacceptably high. This has spurred interest in the development of novel research approaches, with particular interest in the systemic influences of social/organisational and technological factors. In response, the Hopkinton Conference on Sociotechnical Systems and Safety was organised to assess the current state of knowledge in the area and to identify research priorities. Over the course of several months prior to the conference, leading international experts drafted collaborative, state-of-the-art reviews covering various aspects of sociotechnical systems and safety. These papers, presented in this special issue, cover topics ranging from the identification of key concepts and definitions to sociotechnical characteristics of safe and unsafe organisations. This paper provides an overview of the conference and introduces key themes and topics. Practitioner Summary: Sociotechnical approaches to workplace safety are intended to draw practitioners' attention to the critical influence that systemic social/organisational and technological factors exert on safety-relevant outcomes. This paper introduces major themes addressed in the Hopkinton Conference within the context of current workplace safety research and practice challenges.","[Noy, Y.

The early problem definition phase requires an application of systems thinking with adequate modeling tools and methods. Then, the later problem definition phase and early system architecting phase requires transferring the captured problem to systems engineering tools and methods through emerging techniques such as model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using SysML (MBSE is the practice of using a modeling tools to capture systems engineering diagrams). This paper presents a method for capturing a problem through systemigrams and the Boardman soft systems methodology and then directly translating the systemigrams into SysML diagrams. With MBSE increasing in usage, this method could provide a time savings opportunity during model development along with the possibility of lowering information distortion or loss that can occur during transformation of systems thinking to systems engineering activities. This paper includes a case study which demonstrates how the proposed approach was applied on a problem being considered by the U.S. Army-Contingency Basing for Small Combat Units. Finally, this paper will provide the conclusion on the development of the method and describe future research directions that can allow systems thinking and MBSE to function in a congruent methodology.","[Cloutier, Robert; Bone, Mary] Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Sauser, Brian] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Taylor, Andrew] US Army Natick Soldier Res, Ctr Dev & Engn, Natick, MA 01760 USA","Sauser, B (reprint author), Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",brian.sauser@unt.edu,,,Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC); University Affiliated Research Center,This work was supported by the Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC).

Posaconazole, the most advanced new anti-chagasic drug candidate, did not fully confirm its initial potential in a Phase II clinical trial for chronic Chagas' disease. Given that posaconazole is highly active against Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro, and was very well tolerated in clinical trials, it should not be abandoned. Rather, a combination therapy may provide a highly promising outlook. Systems-scale approaches facilitate the hunt for a combination partner for posaconazole, which acts by blocking sterol biosynthesis. Mounting evidence suggests the functional interactions between sterols and sphingolipids in vivo. Here, we propose combining sterol and sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors to advance drug development in Chagas' disease.","[Fuegi, Matthias A.; Kaiser, Marcel; Tanner, Marcel; Maeser, Pascal; Guan, Xue Li] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Fuegi, Matthias A.; Kaiser, Marcel; Tanner, Marcel; Maeser, Pascal; Guan, Xue Li] Univ Basel, CH-4000 Basel, Switzerland; [Schneiter, Roger] Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Guan, XL (reprint author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",xueli.guan@unibas.ch,,"Maser, Pascal/0000-0003-3122-1941",Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione [PZ00P3_136738],X.L.G. was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione (PZ00P3_136738).

At the individual level the role of risk behaviour (sometimes deliberate and sometimes from inexperience or other non-deliberate causes) in adolescent road mortality is well documented. However, little is known about the extent to which the 'road system' itself may also have an impact on younger adolescents' road mortality. This, by providing a safe or unsafe road environment for all road users (System-induced exposure) and by allowing access to high-risk vehicles at a young or older age through the legal licensing age. This study seeks to explore these relationships by analysing the extent to which the road mortality of 10 to 17 year olds in various jurisdictions can be predicted from the System-induced Exposure (SiE) in a jurisdiction and from its legal licensing age to drive motor vehicles. SiE was operationalized as the number of road fatalities per 105 inhabitants/all ages together, but excluding the 10 to 17 year olds. Data on road fatalities during the years 2001 through 2008 were obtained from the OECD International Road Traffic Accident Database (IRTAD) and from the USA NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database for 29 early and 10 late licensing jurisdictions. Linear mixed models were fitted with annual 'Adolescent road mortality per capita' for 2001 through 2008 as the dependent variable, and time-dependent SiE' and time-independent 'Licensing system' as predictor variables. To control for different levels of motorisation, the time-dependent variable 'Annual per capita vehicle distance travelled' was used as a covariate. Licensing system of a jurisdiction was entered as a categorical predictor variable with late licensing countries as a baseline group. The study found support for the protective effects of SiE on adolescent safety. If SiE increased by one unit, the mortality rate of 10 to 17 year olds increased by 0.487 units. No support was found for a protective effect of late licensing for this age group. Thus, compared to young adolescents who are allowed to drive motor vehicles in early licensing jurisdictions, late licensing does not provide extra protection for pre-license adolescents. This finding is probably the result of the high risks associated with alternative transport modes, such as moped riding and bicycling. Also, the fact that the study only included risks to young adolescents themselves and did not include the risks they might pose to other road users and passengers may have contributed to this finding, because such risks are greater when driving a motor vehicle than riding a moped or a bicycle. Therefore, to advance our understanding of the impact of licensing systems, more study is needed into the benefits of early or late licensing, thereby considering these wider effects as well.

Proponents of the ACA have long argued that health reform was needed by the millions of uninsured person who suffered from health disparities, took little advantage of health prevention advice, and faced issues of access to providers as well as insurers. In addition the ACA seeks to address our uncontrollable spending on health care delivery. This article highlights the ACA from a systems perspective. The conceptual model presented encompasses both health reform variables (eg, health care provisions, key legislative components, system environment) and system variables (eg, inputs, outputs, feedback, and throughput) needed to understand current health care reform efforts from a systems perspective. The model presented shows how the interrelationships and interconnections of elements of a system come together to achieve its purpose or goal.","Univ Kentucky, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Sci, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Williams, JC (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Sci, 900 South Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",jcwilliams@uky.edu,,,,,"American Public Health Association, 2012, WHY DO WE NEED AFF C; [Anonymous], 2010, PAT PROT AFF CAR ACT; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Leischow SJ, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P403, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.082842; Boardman J, 2013, SYSTEM THINKING; Carman KG, SURVEY ESTIMATES NET; Haines SG, 1998, SYSTEMS THINKING LEA; Hamel L, KAISER HLTH TRACKING; Krugman P., NYTIMES; Leischow SJ, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, pS196, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.014; Long SK, HLTH REFORM MONITORI; Meadows DH, 2008, THINKING SYSTEMS PRI; Minyard KJ, 2014, HLTH SYSTEMS, V3, P1; Park E., OFF CHARTS BLOGS CHA; Robertson L, MILLION LOST INSURAN; Teitelbaum J, 2013, 2013 ANN HLTH REF UP; The Henry J.

From all three, stem ideas promoting the importance of differentiation (boundaries), connectedness, relations, and feedback. The congruence of these ideas formed independently, in different disciplines, on different continents, at roughly the same time speaks to the deep resonance systems concepts have on understanding our world. Consistent as well, is the insight that individual objects emerge from the structural couplings of their physical and social environmental context. These systems concepts are applied here to classify diversity in a holistic and integrated fashion and then extended to inform the question of sustainability. Sustainable systems are ones that are able to maintain coherent self-organization and simultaneously, recursively extend interactions to neighboring coherent wholes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The terms can be made more serviceable by distinguishing between definitions by extension and definitions by intension. Difficulties with the term 'intensification' are addressed by considering the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). This reverses Green Revolution thinking about intensification as a matter of increasing material inputs. Changes in crop management can raise food output by reducing such inputs, with increased reliance on knowledge and management that use available resources more productively and sustainably. Its initial increases in labor inputs are usually transitory. Conjunctions of different disciplines and different levels of analysis and action are considered with reference to the factors of nestedness and contingence. Subjects bearing on sustainable intensification which can benefit from disciplinary convergence include: biogeochemistry to address problems of climate change; part-time farming to adapt to changing economic opportunities; and symbiotic endophytes that can enhance crop health and growth. The concept of 'causation' is disaggregated to consider 'processual' as distinguished from 'mechanistic' causation. Systems thinking is likely to be more productive for addressing interactions within and between subsystems rather than for theorizing about systems as a whole.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Uphoff, N (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ntu1@cornell.edu,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2009, IPASTOAFWC200528SC42; Thakur AK, 2010, EXP AGR, V46, P77, DOI 10.1017/S0014479709990548; Chi F, 2005, APPL ENVIRON MICROB, V71, P7271, DOI 10.1128/AEM.71.11.7271-7278.2005; Garnett T, 2013, SCIENCE, V341, P33, DOI 10.1126/science.1234485; Chi F, 2010, PROTEOMICS, V10, P1861, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200900694; Moser CM, 2003, AGR SYST, V76, P1085, DOI 10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00041-0; Sinha SK, 2007, AGR WATER MANAGE, V87, P55, DOI 10.1016/j.agwat.2006.06.009; Ndiiri JA, 2013, AGR WATER MANAGE, V129, P44, DOI 10.1016/j.agwat.2013.07.006; [Anonymous], REPORT INT PANEL EXP; Anas I, 2011, PADDY WATER ENVIRON, V9, P53, DOI 10.1007/s10333-011-0260-8; Sheehy JE, 2004, FIELD CROP RES, V88, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.fcr.2003.12.006; Zhao LM, 2009, EXP AGR, V45, P275, DOI 10.1017/S0014479709007583; Barrett CB, 2004, AM J AGR ECON, V86, P869, DOI 10.1111/j.0002-9092.2004.00640.x; Thakur AK, 2013, PLANT SOIL, V370, P59, DOI 10.1007/s11104-013-1612-5; Anthofer J, 2004, REPORT FOOD SECURITY; Behera D, 2013, ENHANCING AGR LIVELI; Brady N.

Although not new to the field of epidemiology, two frameworks that provide epidemiologists with a foundation for understanding the complex contexts in which programs and policies are implemented were presented to maternal and child health (MCH) professionals at the 2012 co-hosted 18th Annual MCH Epidemiology Conference and 22nd CityMatCH Urban Leadership Conference. The complex systems approach offers researchers in MCH the opportunity to understand the functioning of social, medical, environmental, and behavioral factors within the context of implemented public health programs. Implementation science provides researchers with a framework to translate the evidence-based program interventions into practices and policies that impact health outcomes. Both approaches offer MCH epidemiologists conceptual frameworks with which to re-envision how programs are implemented, monitored, evaluated, and reported to the larger public health audience. By using these approaches, researchers can begin to understand and measure the broader public health context, account for the dynamic interplay of the social environment, and ultimately, develop more effective MCH programs and policies.","[Kroelinger, Charlan D.; Grigorescu, Violanda] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Reprod Hlth, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Chamblee, GA 30341 USA; [Rankin, Kristin M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL USA; [Chambers, David A.] NIMH, Div Serv & Intervent Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Roux, Ana V.

This study analyzes the degree to which the existing PHC system supports their access to human advice, and explores in what ways this system might be strengthened to better meet provider needs. Methods: The study was conducted in a rural district of Pakistan and, with a cross-sectional study design, it employed a range of research methods, namely extensive document review for mapping existing information systems, social network analysis of physicians' advice-seeking practice, and key stakeholder interviews for an in-depth understanding of the experience of physicians. Illustrations were prepared for information flow mechanism, sociographs were generated for analyzing social networks, and content analysis of qualitative findings was carried out for in-depth interpretation of underlying meanings. Results: The findings of this study reveal that non-availability of competent supervisory staff, a focus on improving performance indicators rather than clinical guidance, and a lack of a functional referral system have collectively created an environment in which PHC physicians have developed their own strategies to overcome these constraints. They are well aware of the human expertise available within and outside the district. However, their advice-seeking behavior was dependent upon existence of informal social interaction with the senior specialists. Despite the limitations of the system, the physicians proactively used their professional linkages to seek advice and also to refer patients to the referral center based on their experience and the facilities that they trusted. Conclusions: The absence of functional referral systems, limited effective linkages between PHC and higher levels of care, and a focus on programmatic targets rather than clinical care have each contributed to the isolation of physicians and reactive information seeking behavior. The study findings underscore the need for a functional information system comprising context sensitive knowledge management and translation opportunities for physicians working in PHC centers. Such an information system needs to link people and resources in ways that transcend geography and discipline, and that builds on existing expertise, interpersonal relationships, and trust.","[Malik, Asmat U.] Integrated Hlth Serv, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Willis, Cameron D.] Univ Waterloo, Propel Ctr Populat Hlth Impact, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Hamid, Saima] Govt Pakistan, Hlth Serv Acad, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ulikpan, Anar; Hill, Peter S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia","Malik, AU (reprint author), Integrated Hlth Serv, House 1-B,St 50,Sect F-8-4, Islamabad, Pakistan.",asmat.malik@uqconnect.edu.au,"Hill, Peter/F-2768-2010","Hill, Peter/0000-0001-7091-5108",,,"Blanchet K, 2013, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V28, P143, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs031; Dorsch JL, 2000, B MED LIBR ASSOC, V88, P346; Green ML, 2000, AM J MED, V109, P218, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9343(00)00458-7; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Ely JW, 2005, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V12, P217, DOI 10.1197/jamia.M1608; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; COVELL DG, 1985, ANN INTERN MED, V103, P596; Blanchet K, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P438, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr055; Hawe P, 2004, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V58, P971, DOI 10.1136/jech.2003.014530; Davies K, 2007, HEALTH INFO LIBR J, V24, P78, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2007.00713.x; Bennett NL, 2006, J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH, V26, P120, DOI 10.1002/chp.60; Best A, 2007, TOBACCO CONTROL MONO, V18; Cook DA, 2013, JAMA INTERN MED, V173, P1962, DOI 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.10103; Gkeredakis Emmanouil, 2011, J Health Organ Manag, V25, P298; Gonzalez-Gonzalez AI, 2007, ANN FAM MED, V5, P345, DOI 10.1370/afm.681; HUTH EJ, 1994, ANN INTERN MED, V120, P889; Joint Learning Initiative, 2004, HUM RES HLTH OV CRIS; Kim George R, 2005, BMC Med Inform Decis Mak, V5, P34, DOI 10.1186/1472-6947-5-34; Knoke D, 2008, DATA COLLECTION SOCI, P15; NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, 2006, QUAL SERV IMPR TOOLS; NTC Program, 2012, GUID DIAGN MAN TUB P; OSHEROFF JA, 1991, ANN INTERN MED, V114, P576; Savigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING HLT; Smith R, 1996, BRIT MED J, V313, P1062; Stange KC, 2010, ANN FAM MED, V8, P100, DOI 10.1370/afm.1099; System DHI, 2013, DHIS MONTHL REP JAN; WHO, 2007, EV BUS STRENGTH HLTH; Willis CD, 2014, EVID POLICY, V10, P113, DOI 10.1332/174426413X662815; World Health Organization, 2008, WORLD HLTH REP 2008; Woulfe J, 2010, PREV CHRONIC DIS, V7",30,3,3,2,9,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-4505,,,HEALTH RES POLICY SY,Health Res.

Observing that elements of systems thinking are already common in public health research, the article discusses which of the large body of theories, methods, and tools associated with systems thinking are more useful. The paper reviews the origins of systems thinking, describing a range of the theories, methods, and tools. A common thread is the idea that the behavior of systems is governed by common principles that can be discovered and expressed. They each address problems of complexity, which is a frequent challenge in global health. The different methods and tools are suited to different types of inquiry and involve both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The paper concludes by emphasizing that explicit models used in systems thinking provide new opportunities to understand and continuously test and revise our understanding of the nature of things, including how to intervene to improve people's health.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Peters, DH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Room E8527,615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dpeters@jhu.edu,,"Peters, David/0000-0001-8377-3444",,,"Agyepong IA, 2014, HEALTH RES POLICY SY, V12, DOI 10.1186/1478-4505-12-35; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Arthur W B, 1994, INCREASING RETURNS P; Ashby W.R., 1956, INTRO CYBERNETICS; Axelrod R.

(Concern) worked with two Bangladeshi municipal health departments to support delivery of maternal and child health preventive services. A mid-term evaluation identified sustainability challenges. Concern relied on systems thinking implicitly to re-prioritize sustainability, but stakeholders also required a method, an explicit set of processes, to guide their decisions and choices during and after the project. Methods: Concern chose the Sustainability Framework method to generate creative thinking from stakeholders, create a common vision, and monitor progress. The Framework is based on participatory and iterative steps: defining (mapping) the local system and articulating a long-term vision, describing scenarios for achieving the vision, defining the elements of the model, and selecting corresponding indicators, setting and executing an assessment plan,, and repeated stakeholder engagement in analysis and decisions. Formal assessments took place up to 5 years post-project (2009). Results: Strategic choices for the project were guided by articulating a collective vision for sustainable health, mapping the system of actors required to effect and sustain change, and defining different components of analysis. Municipal authorities oriented health teams toward equity-oriented service delivery efforts, strengthening of the functionality of Ward Health Committees, resource leveraging between municipalities and the Ministry of Health, and mitigation of contextual risks. Regular reference to a vision (and set of metrics (population health, organizational and community capacity) mitigated political factors. Key structures and processes were maintained following elections and political changes. Post-project achievements included the maintenance or improvement 5 years post-project (2009) in 9 of the 11 health indicator gains realized during the project (1999-2004). Some elements of performance and capacity weakened, but reductions in the equity gap achieved during the project were largely maintained post-project. Conclusions: Sustainability is dynamic and results from local systems processes, which can be strengthened through both implicit and explicit systems thinking steps applied with constancy of purpose.","[Sarriot, Eric G.] ICF Int Ctr Design & Res Sustainable Hlth & Human, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Kouletio, Michelle] US Embassy, Cotonou, Benin; [Jahan, Shamim] Univ Chicago Res, Dhaka 123, Bangladesh; [Rasul, Izaz] Concern Worldwide, Hlth Programs, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Musha, A.

In one of the Indian states, Kerala, after routine immunization had reached high coverage in the late 1990s, it started to decline in some of the districts. This paper describes an application of complex adaptive systems theory and methods to understand and explain the phenomena underlying unexpected changes in vaccination coverage. Methods: We used qualitative methods to explore the factors underlying changes in vaccination coverage in two districts in Kerala, one with high and one with low coverage. Content analysis was guided by features inherent to complex adaptive systems such as phase transitions, feedback, path dependence, and self-organization. Causal loop diagrams were developed to depict the interactions among actors and critical events that influenced the changes in vaccination coverage. Results: We identified various complex adaptive system phenomena that influenced the change in vaccination coverage levels in the two districts. Phase transition describes how initial acceptability to vaccination is replaced by a resistance in northern Kerala, which involved new actors; actors attempting to regain acceptability and others who countered it created several feedback loops. We also describe how the authorities have responded to declining immunization coverage and its impact on vaccine acceptability in the context of certain highly connected actors playing disproportionate influence over household vaccination decisions. Theoretical exposition of our findings reveals the important role of trust in health workers and institutions that shape the interactions of actors leading to complex adaptive system phenomena. Conclusions: As illustrated in this study, a complex adaptive system lens helps to uncover the 'real' drivers for change. This approach assists researchers and decision makers to systematically explore the driving forces and factors in each setting and develop appropriate and timely strategies to address them. The study calls for greater consideration of dynamics of vaccine acceptability while formulating immunization policies and program strategies. The analytical approaches adopted in this study are not only applicable to immunization or Kerala but to all complex interventions, health systems problems, and contexts.","[Varghese, Joe] Delhi NCR, Publ Hlth Fdn India, Ctr Chron Dis Control & Governance Hub, Gurgaon 122002, India; [Kutty, V.

Systems thinking emphasizes the role of diverse stakeholders in designing solutions to system problems, including sustainability. The objective of this paper is to compare the definition and use of sustainability indicators developed through the Sustainability Analysis Process in two rehabilitation sectors, one in Nepal and one in Somaliland, and analyse the contextual factors (including the characteristics of system stakeholder networks) influencing the use of sustainability data. Methods: Using the Sustainability Analysis Process, participants collectively clarified the boundaries of their respective systems, defined sustainability, and identified sustainability indicators. Baseline indicator data was gathered, where possible, and then researched again 2 years later. As part of the exercise, system stakeholder networks were mapped at baseline and at the 2-year follow-up. We compared stakeholder networks and interrelationships with baseline and 2-year progress toward self-defined sustainability goals. Using in-depth interviews and observations, additional contextual factors affecting the use of sustainability data were identified. Results: Differences in the selection of sustainability indicators selected by local stakeholders from Nepal and Somaliland reflected differences in the governance and structure of the present rehabilitation system. At 2 years, differences in the structure of social networks were more marked. In Nepal, the system stakeholder network had become more dense and decentralized. Financial support by an international organization facilitated advancement toward self-identified sustainability goals. In Somaliland, the small, centralised stakeholder network suffered a critical rupture between the system's two main information brokers due to competing priorities and withdrawal of international support to one of these. Progress toward self-defined sustainability was nil. Conclusions: The structure of the rehabilitation system stakeholder network characteristics in Nepal and Somaliland evolved over time and helped understand the changing nature of relationships between actors and their capacity to work as a system rather than a sum of actors. Creating consensus on a common vision of sustainability requires additional system-level interventions such as identification of and support to stakeholders who promote systems thinking above individual interests.","[Blanchet, Karl; Palmer, Jennifer] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Evidence Disabil, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Palanchowke, Raju] Handicap Int, Khatmandu, Nepal; [Boggs, Dorothy] Handicap Int, London SE1, England; [Jama, Ali] Disabil Action Network, Hargeisa, Somalia; [Girois, Susan] Norfolk Community Serv Board, Norfolk, VA 23509 USA","Blanchet, K (reprint author), Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Int Ctr Evidence Disabil, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",karl.blanchet@lshtm.ac.uk,,,,,"Blanchet K, 2013, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V28, P143, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs031; Folke C, 2002, AMBIO, V31, P437, DOI 10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0437:RASDBA]2.0.CO;2; Sarriot EG, 2004, INT J HEALTH PLAN M, V19, P23, DOI 10.1002/hpm.744; Scheirer MA, 2005, AM J EVAL, V26, P320, DOI 10.1177/1098214005278752; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; CHAMBERS R, 1994, WORLD DEV, V22, P1253, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(94)90003-5; Oh HS, 2004, ACAD MANAGE J, V47, P860; Thompson GN, 2006, J ADV NURS, V53, P691, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03775.x; Manring SL, 2007, ORGAN ENVIRON, V20, P325, DOI 10.1177/1086026607305738; MARSDEN PV, 1990, ANNU REV SOCIOL, V16, P435; Valente TW, 2007, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V34, P881, DOI 10.1177/1090198106297855; Grimble R, 1997, AGR SYST, V55, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0308-521X(97)00006-1; McCool SF, 2004, ENVIRON MANAGE, V33, P294, DOI 10.1007/s00267-003-0084-4; Borgatti SP, 2009, SCIENCE, V323, P892, DOI 10.1126/science.1165821; Gruen RL, 2008, LANCET, V372, P1579, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61659-1; Mahoney J, 1999, AM J SOCIOL, V104, P1154, DOI 10.1086/210139; Blanchet K, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P438, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr055; CHAMBERS R, 1994, WORLD DEV, V22, P953, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(94)90141-4; FREEMAN LC, 1979, SOC NETWORKS, V1, P215, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(78)90021-7; Rametsteiner E, 2011, ECOL INDIC, V11, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.06.009; Cornelissen AMG, 2001, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V86, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00272-3; Folke C, 2005, ANNU REV ENV RESOUR, V30, P441, DOI 10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144511; Brugha R, 2000, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V15, P239, DOI 10.1093/heapol/15.3.239; Pluye P, 2004, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V27, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2004.01.001; Asch SE, 1953, GROUP DYNAMICS RES T; Atkinson S, 2002, SOC SCI MED, V55, P113, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00213-1; Bates R., 1998, ANAL NARRATIVES; Bell S, 2008, SUSTAINABILITY INDIC; Bell S., 1999, SUSTAINABILITY INDIC; Blanchet K, 2013, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V38, P28, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2012.11.003; Blanchet K, 2012, SUSTAINABILITY ANAL; Blanchet Karl, 2013, Int J Health Policy Manag, V1, P177, DOI 10.15171/ijhpm.2013.31; Blanchet K, 2013, DISABIL REH IN PRESS; Bloom G, 2001, PLURALISM MARKETISAT, V136; Bodin O, 2006, ECOLOGY SOC, V11, P55; Bossert TJ, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P8, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr008; Burt RS, 2003, NEW EC SOCIOLOGY DEV, P148; Darton RC, 2006, USING INDICATOR SETS; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Diani Mario, 2003, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS NET, P299; Fitzpatrick R, 1994, Qual Health Care, V3, P107, DOI 10.1136/qshc.3.2.107; Folke C, 1998, LINKING SOCIAL ECOLO; Glouberman S., 2002, COMPLICATED COMPLEX; Greene JC, 1997, EVAL PRACT, V18, P25, DOI 10.1016/S0886-1633(97)90005-2; Groves L., 2004, INCLUSIVE AID CHANGI; Kasemir B, 1999, INT J ENVIRON POLLUT, V11, P407, DOI 10.1504/IJEP.1999.002268; Keen J, 2000, QUALITATIVE RES HLTH; Levi M., 2003, ANAL NARRATIVE APPRO; Midgley David, 2005, ESSENTIAL M MIDGLEY; MITCHELL G, 1995, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V2, P104; Moore S, 2003, DISASTERS, V27, P305, DOI 10.1111/j.0361-3666.2003.00235.x; Newman L., 2005, ECOLOGY SOC, V10, pr2; Nulden U, 1996, IEEE COMP SOC INF SY, P136; Olsson P, 2004, ECOL SOC, V9; Riggan M, 2008, IMPLEMENTATION GAP U, P103; Salam MA, 2006, FOREST POLICY ECON, V8, P785, DOI 10.1016/j.forpol.2004.12.004; Sarriot E, 2009, INT J HEALTH PLAN M, V24, P326, DOI 10.1002/hpm.1012; Stacey R., 2011, STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; Stame N., 2004, EVALUATION, V10, P58, DOI DOI 10.1177/1356389004043135; Tahir AC, 2010, J CLEAN PROD, V18, P1598, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.012; Thurston WE, 2003, EVALUATION, V9, P453, DOI 10.1177/1356389003094006; Walt G., 1996, HLTH POLICY INTRO PR; Yin R., 2003, CASE STUDY RES DESIG; Zimmerman B., 1998, EDGEWARE INSIGHTS CO",64,2,2,8,24,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-4505,,,HEALTH RES POLICY SY,Health Res.

However, such interventions often work in some settings and not in others. Local health systems could be visualised as complex adaptive systems that respond variously to inputs of capacity building interventions, depending on their local conditions and several individual, institutional, and environmental factors. We aim at demonstrating how the realist evaluation approach advances complex systems thinking in healthcare evaluation by applying the approach to understand organisational change within local health systems in the Tumkur district of southern India. Methods: We collected data on several input, process, and outcome measures of performance of the talukas (administrative sub-units of the district) and explore the interplay between the individual, institutional, and contextual factors in contributing to the outcomes using qualitative data (interview transcripts and observation notes) and quantitative measures of commitment, self-efficacy, and supervision style. Results: The talukas of Tumkur district responded differently to the intervention. Their responses can be explained by the interactions between several individual, institutional, and environmental factors. In a taluka with committed staff and a positive intention to make changes, the intervention worked through aligning with existing opportunities from the decentralisation process to improve performance. However, commitment towards the organisation was neither crucial nor sufficient. Committed staff in two other talukas were unable to actualise their intentions to improve organisational performance. In yet another taluka, the leadership was able to compensate for the lack of commitment. Conclusions: Capacity building of local health systems could work through aligning or countering existing relationships between internal (individual and organisational) and external (policy and socio-political environment) attributes of the organisation. At the design and implementation stage, intervention planners need to identify opportunities for such triggering alignments. Local health systems may differ in their internal configuration and hence capacity building programmes need to accommodate possibilities for change through different pathways. By a process of formulating and testing hypotheses, making critical comparisons, discovering empirical patterns, and monitoring their scope and extent, a realist evaluation enables a comprehensive assessment of system-wide change in health systems.","[Prashanth, Nuggehalli Srinivas; Devadasan, Narayanan] Inst Publ Hlth, Bangalore 560085, Karnataka, India; [Prashanth, Nuggehalli Srinivas; Marchal, Bruno; Kegels, Guy; Criel, Bart] Inst Trop Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium","Prashanth, NS (reprint author), Inst Publ Hlth, 250,2 C Main,2 C Cross,Girinagar 1 Phase, Bangalore 560085, Karnataka, India.",prashanthns@iphindia.org,,"Prashanth, Nuggehalli Srinivas/0000-0003-0968-0826",,,"Anil Kumar TK, 2011, CENSUS INDIA 2011 PR, V1; BANDURA A, 1982, AM PSYCHOL, V37, P122, DOI 10.1037//0003-066X.37.2.122; LaFond AK, 2002, INT J HEALTH PLAN M, V17, P3, DOI 10.1002/hpm.649; Marchal B, 2012, EVALUATION-US, V18, P192, DOI 10.1177/1356389012442444; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Sturmberg JP, 2012, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V18, P202, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2011.01792.x; Rowe AK, 2005, LANCET, V366, P1026, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67028-6; McDaniel RR, 2009, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V34, P191, DOI 10.1097/HMR.0b013e31819c8b38; Astbury B, 2010, AM J EVAL, V31, P363, DOI 10.1177/1098214010371972; Greenhalgh T, 2009, MILBANK Q, V87, P391, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00562.x; Moore G, 2014, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V68, P101, DOI 10.1136/jech-2013-202869; Westhorp G, 2012, EVALUATION-US, V18, P405, DOI 10.1177/1356389012460963; Potter C, 2004, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V19, P336, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czh038; de Souza DE, 2013, EVALUATION-US, V19, P141, DOI 10.1177/1356389013485194; Balabanova D, 2011, GOOD HLTH LOW COST 2, P369; Bandura A., 2006, ADOLESCENCE ED, V5, P307; Bunge M, 2004, PHILOS SOC SCI, V34, P182, DOI 10.1177/0048393103262550; Cammann C, 1978, MICHIGAN ORG ASSESSM; Clarke N, 2005, HUMAN RESOURCE DEV I, V8, P185, DOI DOI 10.1080/13678860500100228; Craig P, 2008, BRIT MED J, V337, DOI 10.1136/bmj.a1655; Das GM, 2010, EC POLIT WKLY, Vxlv, P46; Devadasan N, 2008, TRAINING NEEDS ASSES, P78; George A, 2007, REPROD HEALTH MATTER, V15, P91, DOI 10.1016/S0968-8080(07)30318-2; Dieleman Marjolein, 2009, Health Res Policy Syst, V7, P7, DOI 10.1186/1478-4505-7-7; Government of Karnataka, 2005, INV HUM DEV KARN HUM; Government of Karnataka, 2004, REP HIGH POW COMM RE; Hoeree T, 2012, EXTERNAL EVALUATION, P50; Jagosh J, 2013, RES SYNTH METHODS, V5, P131; Kernick D, 2004, COMPLEXITY HEALTHCAR, P400; Kirkpatrick DL, 1998, EVALUATING TRAINING, P289; LIPSEY MW, 1989, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V12, P317, DOI 10.1016/0149-7189(89)90048-7; Marchal B, 2011, WHY DO SOME HOSP PER, P227; Marchal B, 2010, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-10-24; Marchal B, 2013, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V13, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-13-469; Marchal B, 2014, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V14, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-14-378; Marchal B, 2010, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-10-787; Mbindyo P, 2009, IMPLEMENT SCI, V4, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-4-43; Meyer J.P., 1991, HUMAN RESOURCE MANAG, V1, P61, DOI DOI 10.1016/1053-4822(91)90011-Z; MEYER JP, 1989, J APPL PSYCHOL, V74, P152, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.74.1.152; Oldham GR, 1996, ACAD MANAGE J, V39, P607, DOI 10.2307/256657; Parsons T., 1977, SOCIAL SYSTEMS EVOLU; Patton M.

It argues that the evolution of these schemes has been the outcome of the response of a large number of agents to a rapidly changing context and of efforts by the government to influence this adaptation process and achieve public health goals. Methods: The study draws on several sources of data including a review of official policy documents and academic papers and in-depth interviews with key policy actors at national level and at a sample of localities. Results: The study identifies three major transition points associated with changes in broad development strategy and demonstrates how the adaptation of large numbers of actors to these contextual changes had a major impact on the performance of the health system. Further, it documents how the Ministry of Health viewed its role as both an advocate for the interests of health facilities and health workers and as the agency responsible for ensuring that government health system objectives were met. It is argued that a major reason for the resilience of the health system and its ability to adapt to rapid economic and institutional change was the ability of the Ministry to provide overall strategy leadership. Additionally, it postulates that a number of interest groups have emerged, which now also seek to influence the pathway of health system development. Conclusions: This history illustrates the complex and political nature of the management of health system development and reform. The paper concludes that governments will need to increase their capacity to analyze the health sector as a complex system and to manage change processes.","[Zhang, Xiulan; Xu, Xiaoxin; Chen, Lin; Liang, Xiaoyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy SSDPP, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Bloom, Gerald; Wolcott, Sara J.] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies IDS, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England","Zhang, XL (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy SSDPP, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhang99@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2012, COLL NCMS POL DOC 20; Xiao Y, 2013, SOC SCI MED, V93, P220, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.09.034; [Anonymous], 2011, COLLECTIONS PREMIER; [Anonymous], 2012, GAZ NAT EC C; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P746; Best A, 2012, MILBANK Q, V90, P421, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2012.00670.x; Meng QY, 2014, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V92, P447, DOI 10.2471/BLT.13.131532; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Gericke CA, 2005, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V83, P285; Victora CG, 2005, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V20, pI18, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czi050; Lansing JS, 2003, ANNU REV ANTHROPOL, V32, P183, DOI 10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.093440; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Walt G, 2008, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V23, P308, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czn024; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; Litaker D, 2006, J GEN INTERN MED, V21, pS30, DOI 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00360.x; Holden LM, 2005, J ADV NURS, V52, P651, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03638.x; Meng Q, 2012, LANCET, V379, P805, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60278-5; Miller WL, 1998, J FAM PRACTICE, V46, P369; McDaniel RR, 2009, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V34, P191, DOI 10.1097/HMR.0b013e31819c8b38; Anderson RA, 2003, NURS RES, V52, P12, DOI 10.1097/00006199-200301000-00003; Zhang DQ, 2008, LANCET, V372, P1865, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61355-0; Leischow SJ, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P403, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.082842; Yip WCM, 2012, LANCET, V379, P833, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61880-1; You XD, 2009, HEALTH POLICY, V91, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.11.012; [Anonymous], 2013, STAT REP HLTH FAM PL; Wagstaff A, 2009, HEALTH ECON, V18, pS7, DOI 10.1002/hec.1518; Manson SM, 2001, GEOFORUM, V32, P405, DOI 10.1016/S0016-7185(00)00035-X; Keshavarz N, 2010, SOC SCI MED, V70, P1467, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.034; Begun JW, 2003, ADV HLTH CARE ORG TH, P253; Boustani MA, 2010, CLIN INTERV AGING, V5, P141; Cao P, 2009, PARTY HIST RES TEACH, V4, P18; CCCPC, 2002, DEC CENTR COMM CPC S; de Haan A, 2011, CAN J DEV STUD, V32, P399; Director of National Health and Family Planning Commission, COUNT LEV HOSP REF B; Folke C, 2010, ECOL SOC, V15; Gatrell AC, 2005, SOC SCI MED, V60, P2661, DOI 10.1016/j.socsimed.2004.11.002; Gell-Mann M, 1994, COMPLEXITY METAPHORS; Holland J.

We describe the complex patterns that characterize the evolution of dual practice in Uganda, and the local management practices that emerged in response, in five government facilities. An in-depth understanding of dual practice can contribute to policy discussions on improving public sector performance. Methods: A multiple case study design with embedded units of analysis was supplemented by interviews with policy stakeholders and a review of historical and policy documents. Five facility case studies captured the perspective of doctors, nurses, and health managers through semi-structured in-depth interviews. A causal loop diagram illustrated interactions and feedback between old and new actors, as well as emerging roles and relationships. Results: The causal loop diagram illustrated how feedback related to dual practice policy developed in Uganda. As opportunities for dual practice grew and the public health system declined over time, government providers increasingly coped through dual practice. Over time, government restrictions to dual practice triggered policy resistance and protest from government providers. Resulting feedback contributed to compromising the supply of government providers and, potentially, of service delivery outcomes. Informal government policies and restrictions replaced the formal restrictions identified in the early phases. In some instances, government health managers, particularly those in hospitals, developed their own practices to cope with dual practice and to maintain public sector performance. Management practices varied according to the health manager's attitude towards dual practice and personal experience with dual practice. These practices were distinct in hospitals. Hospitals faced challenges managing internal dual practice opportunities, such as those created by externally-funded research projects based within the hospital. Private wings' inefficiencies and strict fee schedule made them undesirable work locations for providers. Conclusions: Dual practice prevails because public and private sector incentives, non-financial and financial, are complementary. Local management practices for dual practice have not been previously documented and provide learning opportunities to inform policy discussions. Understanding how dual practice evolves and how it is managed locally is essential for health workforce policy, planning, and performance discussions in Uganda and similar settings.","[Paina, Ligia; Bennett, Sara; Peters, David H.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ssengooba, Freddie] Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management, Kampala, Uganda","Paina, L (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,Suite E8541, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",LPAINA@jhu.edu,,"Peters, David/0000-0001-8377-3444",,,"Agyepong IA, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P20, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs083; Rwashana AS, 2009, HEALTH INFORM J, V15, P95, DOI 10.1177/1460458209102971; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; [Anonymous], 2012, VENS PERS LEARN ED; Chaudhury N, 2006, J ECON PERSPECT, V20, P91, DOI 10.1257/089533006776526058; Ranson MK, 2010, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V88, P435, DOI 10.2471/BLT.09.066290; Franco LM, 2002, SOC SCI MED, V54, P1255, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00094-6; Socha KZ, 2011, HEALTH POLICY, V102, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.10.017; Asiimwe D, 2008, IDENTIFICATION PRIOR; Berman P, 2004, MULTIPLE PUBLIC PRIV; Biglaiser G, 2007, RAND J ECON, V38, P21; Bloom G, 2009, MAKING HLTH MARKETS; Chomitz K, 1998, WHAT DO DOCTORS WHAT; Eggleston K, 2006, HEALTH POLICY, V78, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.09.007; Ferrinho P, 2004, HUMAN RESOURCES HLTH, V2, P1; Forrester J.W., 1961, IND DYNAMICS; Garcia-Prado A, 2007, HEALTH POLICY, V84, P142, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.03.006; Gonzalez P, 2013, J HEALTH ECON, V32, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.08.005; Gonzalez P, 2004, HEALTH ECON, V13, P505, DOI 10.1002/hec.890; Government of Uganda-Ministry of Health, 2011, NAT POL PUBL PRIV PA; Gruen R, 2002, SOC SCI MED, V54, P267, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00026-0; Gupta N, 2009, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V7, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-7-22; Iliffe J., 1998, E AFRICAN DOCTORS HI; International Finance Corporation, 2008, BUS HLTH AFR PARTN P; Karugaba M, 2011, DOCTOR SUSPENDED FAI; Kiwanuka SN, 2011, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD008405.pub2; Kiwawulo C, 2013, NAKAMYA WENT HOSP GI; Mandelli A, 2005, SURV PRIV HLTH FAC U; Miles MB, 2013, QUALITATIVE DATA ANA; Ministry of Health, 2009, HUM RES HLTH AUD REP; Okwero P, 2010, WOR BANK WORK PAPER, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8290-5; Opio F, 1996, IMPACT STRUCTURAL AD; Patel B, 2008, EUR J OPER RES, V185, P905, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2006.02.056; Rwashana AS, 2008, 26 INT C SYST DYN SO; Saldana J., 2009, CODING MANUAL QUALIT; Sterman J.D., 2000, BUSINESS DYNAMICS SY; Tan J, 2005, COMMUN ACM, V48, P36, DOI 10.1145/1060710.1060737; Vujicic M, 2011, SOC SCI MED, V73, P970, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.010",40,2,2,4,12,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-4505,,,HEALTH RES POLICY SY,Health Res.

Despite child survival and safe motherhood programmes towards reducing child mortality, insufficient attention has been given to this critical first month of life. There is urgent need to innovatively employ alternative solutions that take into account the intricate complexities of neonatal health and the health systems. In this paper, we set out to empirically contribute to understanding the causes of the stagnating neonatal mortality by applying a systems thinking approach to explore the dynamics arising from the neonatal health complexity and non-linearity and its interplay with health systems factors, using Uganda as a case study. Methods: Literature reviews and interviews were conducted in two divisions of Kampala district with high neonatal mortality rates with mothers at antenatal clinics and at home, village health workers, community leaders, healthcare decision and policy makers, and frontline health workers from both public and private health facilities. Data analysis and brainstorming sessions were used to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) depicting the causes of neonatal mortality, which were validated by local and international stakeholders. Results: We developed two CLDs for demand and supply side issues, depicting the range of factors associated with neonatal mortality such as maternal health, level of awareness of maternal and newborn health, and availability and quality of health services, among others. Further, the reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that resulted from this complexity were also examined. The potential high leverage points include special gender considerations to ensure that girls receive essential education, thereby increasing maternal literacy rates, improved socioeconomic status enabling mothers to keep healthy and utilise health services, improved supervision, and internal audits at the health facilities as well as addressing the gaps in resources (human, logistics, and drugs). Conclusions: Synthesis of theoretical concepts through CLDs facilitated our understanding and interpretation of the interactions and feedback loops that contributed to the stagnant neonatal mortality rates in Uganda, which is the first step towards discussing and exploring the potential strategies and their likely impact.","[Rwashana, Agnes Semwanga] Makerere Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Syst, Kampala, Uganda; [Nakubulwa, Sarah] Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Kampala, Uganda; [Nakakeeto-Kijjambu, Margaret] Kampala Childrens Hosp, Kampala, Uganda; [Adam, Taghreed] WHO, Alliance Hlth Policy & Syst Res, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Rwashana, AS (reprint author), Makerere Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Syst, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.",asemwanga@cit.ac.ug,,,,,"Agyepong IA, 2011, HEALTH POLICY, V99, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.09.018; Rwashana AS, 2009, HEALTH INFORM J, V15, P95, DOI 10.1177/1460458209102971; Shiell A, 2008, BRIT MED J, V336, P1281, DOI 10.1136/bmj.39569.510521.AD; Kamuzora P, 2007, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V22, P95, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czm001; [Anonymous], 2013, VENS SOFTW VERS 6 2; MASON RO, 1973, MANAGE SCI, V19, P475, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.19.5.475; [Anonymous], 2010, SPSS 10 0 COMM SYNT; Chowdhury QH, 2010, INT J SOCIOL ANTHROP, V2, P118; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Finlayson K, 2013, PLOS MED, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001373; Forrester J.W., 1961, IND DYNAMICS; Galliers R.

The way providers are paid is a critical part of this process because it can create incentives and patterns of behaviour related to supply. The objective of this work was to describe provider behaviour related to supply of health services to insured clients in Ghana and the influence of provider payment methods on incentives and behaviour. Methods: A mixed methods study involving grey and published literature reviews, as well as health management information system and primary data collection and analysis was used. Primary data collection involved in-depth interviews, observations of time spent obtaining service, prescription analysis, and exit interviews with clients. Qualitative data was analysed manually to draw out themes, commonalities, and contrasts. Quantitative data was analysed in Excel and Stata. Causal loop and cause tree diagrams were used to develop a qualitative explanatory model of provider supply incentives and behaviour related to payment method in context. Results: There are multiple provider payment methods in the Ghanaian health system. National Health Insurance provider payment methods are the most recent additions. At the time of the study, the methods used nationwide were the Ghana Diagnostic Related Groupings payment for services and an itemized and standardized fee schedule for medicines. The influence of provider payment method on supply behaviour was sometimes intuitive and sometimes counter intuitive. It appeared to be related to context and the interaction of the methods with context and each other rather than linearly to any given method. Conclusions: As countries work towards Universal Health Coverage, there is a need to holistically design, implement, and manage provider payment methods reforms from systems rather than linear perspectives, since the latter fail to recognize the effects of context and the between-methods and context interactions in producing net effects.","[Agyepong, Irene A.; Aryeetey, Geneieve C.; Nonvignon, Justice; Esena, Reuben; Aikins, Moses] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management HPPM, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Asenso-Boadi, Francis] Natl Hlth Insurance Author, Accra, Ghana; [Antwi, Edward] Ghana Hlth Serv Greater Accra Reg Hlth Directorat, Accra, Ghana; [Ankrah, Daniel] Korle Bu Teaching Hosp, Accra, Ghana; [Adjei-Acquah, Charles] Ghana Hlth Serv, PPMED, Accra, Ghana; [Arhinful, Daniel K.] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Legon, Accra, Ghana","Agyepong, IA (reprint author), Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management HPPM, POB LG 13, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",iagyepong@hotmail.com,,,,,"Agyepong IA, 2011, HEALTH POLICY, V99, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.09.018; Agyepong IA, 2008, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V23, P150, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czn002; Jehu-Appiah C, 2011, SOC SCI MED, V72, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.025; Jegers M, 2002, HEALTH POLICY, V60, P255, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8510(01)00216-0; [Anonymous], 2011, SSNIT ANN REP 2011; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P746; Kutzin J, 2001, HEALTH POLICY, V56, P171, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8510(00)00149-4; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; Bhutta ZA, 2010, LANCET, V375, P2032, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60678-2; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; McIntyre D, 2008, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V86, P871, DOI 10.2471/BLT.08.053413; [Anonymous], 2013, SYSTEMS BEHAV CAUSAL; Jehu-Appiah C, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P222, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr032; Ansah EK, 2009, PLOS MED, V6, P232, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000033; Arhinful DK, 2009, MINISTRY HLTH GHANA; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Gauri V, 2001, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V2624; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2004, NAT HLTH INS POL FRA; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2013, HOL ASS HLTH SECT PR; Ghana Ministry of Health, 2002, NAT HLTH INS POL FRA; Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) Ghana Health Service (GHS) and ICF Macro, 2008, GHAN DEM HLTH SURV; Hesse A, 2007, NATL HLTH INSURANCE; Index Mundi, 2013, INDEX MUNDI; Kipp R, 2013, DEV NATIONS CAN GAIN; Mathauer I, 2012, DRG BASED PAYMENT SY; Senge P., 1990, 5 DISCIPLINE ART PRA; Sodzi-Tettey S, 2012, Ghana Med J, V46, P189; Tilley N., 1997, REALISTIC EVALUATION; UN, 2012, UN GEN ASS 67 SESS A; Witter S, 2009, BMC INT HEALTH HUM R, V9, DOI 10.1186/1472-698X-9-20; WHO, 2010, WORLD MALARIA REPORT 2010, P1; World Health Organization, 2005, SUST HLTH FIN UN COV; World Health Organization, 2006, WORK TOG HLTH WORLD",33,2,2,8,9,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-4505,,,HEALTH RES POLICY SY,Health Res.

The idea that safety culture somehow represents a ""systemic view"" on safety is seldom explicitly spoken out, but nevertheless seem to linger behind many safety culture discourses. However, in this paper we argue that the ""new"" contribution to safety management from safety culture never really became integrated with classical engineering principles and concepts. This integration would have been necessary for the development of a more genuine systems-oriented view on safety; e.g. a conception of safety in which human, technological, organisational and cultural factors are understood as mutually interacting elements. Without of this integration, researchers and the users of the various tools and methods associated with safety culture have sometimes fostered a belief that ""safety culture"" in fact represents such a systemic view about safety. This belief is, however, not backed up by theoretical or empirical evidence. It is true that safety culture, at least in some sense, represents a holistic term a totality of factors that include human, organisational and technological aspects. However, the departure for such safety culture models is still human and organisational factors rather than technology (or safety) itself. The aim of this paper is to critically review the various uses of the concept of safety culture as representing a systemic view on safety. The article will take a look at the concepts of culture and safety culture based on previous studies, and outlines in more detail the theoretical challenges in safety culture as a systems concept. The paper also presents recommendations on how to make safety culture more systemic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The House of Quality (HoQ) in QED methodology is a systematic tool to consider the inter-relationships between two factors. In this paper, three HoQs are used to consider the interrelationships between tasks and hazards, hazards and events, and events and preventive/protective measures. The final priority weights of events are defined by considering their project-specific preliminary weights, probability of occurrence, and effects on the victim and the company. The priority weights of the preventive/protective measures obtained in the last HoQ are fed into a 0-1 knapsack model for the investment decision. Then, the selected preventive/protective measures can be adapted to the task design. The proposed step-by-step methodology can be applied to any stage of a project to design the workplace for occupational safety and health, and continuous improvement for safety is endorsed by the closed loop characteristic of the integrated methodology.

A debate exists in the research literature over whether the SCM remains a viable tool for accident analysis. Critics of the model suggest that it provides a sequential, oversimplified view of accidents. Conversely, proponents suggest that it embodies the concepts of systems theory, as per the contemporary systemic analysis techniques. The aim of this paper was to consider whether the SCM can provide a systems thinking approach and remain a viable option for accident analysis. To achieve this, the train derailment at Grayrigg was analysed with an SCM-based model (the ATSB accident investigation model) and two systemic accident analysis methods (AcciMap and STAMP). The analysis outputs and usage of the techniques were compared. The findings of the study showed that each model applied the systems thinking approach. However, the ATSB model and AcciMap graphically presented their findings in a more succinct manner, whereas STAMP more clearly embodied the concepts of systems theory. The study suggests that, whilst the selection of an analysis method is subject to trade-offs that practitioners and researchers must make, the SCM remains a viable model for accident analysis.

This article describes an application of a systems theory-based approach, Rasmussen's (1997. Safety Science 27, 183), risk management framework, to the analysis of the factors influencing safety during manual handling activities in a freight handling organisation. Observations of manual handling activities, cognitive decision method interviews with workers (n = 27) and interviews with managers (n = 35) were used to gather information about three manual handling activities. Hierarchical task analysis and thematic analysis were used to identify potential risk factors and performance shaping factors across the levels of Rasmussen's framework. These different data sources were then integrated using Rasmussen's Accimap technique to provide an overall analysis of the factors influencing safety during manual handling activities in this context. The findings demonstrate how a systems theory-based approach can be applied to this domain, and suggest that policy-orientated, rather than worker-orientated, changes are required to prevent future manual handling injuries.

Methods: A modeled population is subject to only two diseases. Disease A is a curable disease that can be shortened by curative care. Disease B is an instantly fatal but preventable disease. Curative care workers are financed by public spending and private fees to cure disease A. Non-personal, preventive services are delivered by public health workers supported solely by public spending to prevent disease B. Each type of worker tries to tilt the balance of government spending towards their interests. Their influence on the government is proportional to their accumulated revenue. Results: The model demonstrates effects on lost disability-adjusted life years and costs over the course of several epidemics of each disease. Policy interventions are tested including: i) an outside donor rationally donates extra money to each type of disease precisely in proportion to the size of epidemics of each disease; ii) lobbying is eliminated; iii) fees for personal health services are eliminated; iv) the government continually rebalances the funding for prevention by ring-fencing it to protect it from lobbying. The model exhibits a ""spend more get less"" equilibrium in which higher revenue by the curative sector is used to influence government allocations away from prevention towards cure. Spending more on curing disease A leads paradoxically to a higher overall disease burden of unprevented cases of disease B. This paradoxical behavior of the model can be stopped by eliminating lobbying, eliminating fees for curative services, and ring-fencing public health funding. Conclusions: We have created an artificial system as a laboratory to gain insights about the trade-offs between curative and preventive health allocations, and the effect of indicative policy interventions. The underlying dynamics of this artificial system resemble features of modern health systems where a self-perpetuating industry has grown up around disease-specific curative programs like HIV/AIDS or malaria. The model shows how the growth of curative care services can crowd both fiscal and policy space for the practice of population level prevention work, requiring dramatic interventions to overcome these trends.","[Bishai, David; Li, Qingfeng] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Paina, Ligia; Peters, David H.; Hyder, Adnan A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bishai, David; Li, Qingfeng; Hyder, Adnan A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Int Injury Res Unit, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Bishai, D (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,Room E4622, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dbishai1@jhu.edu,,"Peters, David/0000-0001-8377-3444",,,"Swanson RC, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P54, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs090; Merrill JA, 2013, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V20, pE131, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001289; Grepin KA, 2012, HEALTH AFFAIR, V31, P1406, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0279; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Paina L, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P365, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr054; [Anonymous], 2010, 2 ESS PUBL HLTH FUNC; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Anand S, 2002, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V56, P485, DOI 10.1136/jech.56.7.485; Walker N, 2013, LANCET, V382, P1029, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61748-1; Case A, 2011, DEMOGRAPHY, V48, P675, DOI 10.1007/s13524-011-0026-3; [Anonymous], 1968, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V205, P868; Bishai D, 2003, HEALTH ECON, V12, P415, DOI 10.1002/hec.732; Barber P, 2010, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V8, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-8-24; Bevan D, 2007, PROMOTING PROTECTING; Bishai D, 2003, WHAT IS IMPACT VITAM; Boama V, 2009, INT J GYNECOL OBSTET, V106, P125, DOI 10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.03.023; Briscombe B, 2010, IMPROVING RESOURCE A; Centers for Disease Cotrol, 1992, MMWR-MORBID MORTAL W, V41, P529; Department of Health UK, 2010, EQ EXC LIB NHS; Epstein J.M., 2007, GENERATIVE SOCIAL SC; Flessa S, 2000, Health Care Manag Sci, V3, P249, DOI 10.1023/A:1019053710258; Forrester J.W., 1961, IND DYNAMICS; Getzen T, 2007, HLTH EC FINANCING; Grogan CM, 2012, J HEALTH POLIT POLIC, V37, P329, DOI 10.1215/03616878-1538638; Hipgrave DB, 2014, SOC SCI MED, V102, P190, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.056; Holmes JL, 2012, HIV CLIN, V24, P5; Hunsmann M, 2012, SOC SCI MED, V74, P1477, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.01.023; Jamison DT, 2006, DISEASE CONTROL PRIORITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, 2ND EDITION, P1; Loue S, 2006, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V60, P458, DOI 10.1136/jech.2004.023044; Loyo Heather Karina, 2013, Health Promot Pract, V14, P53, DOI 10.1177/1524839910390305; Miller G, 2008, ADV HEALTH ECON HEAL, V19, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0731-2199(08)19001-X; Neumann P.

Using theory about complex adaptive systems and policy implementation, this paper considers how actors' sensemaking and the exercise of discretionary power currently combine to challenge PHC re-orientation in the South African health system; and provides examples of leadership practices that promote sensemaking and power use in support of PHC. Methods: The paper draws on observational, interview, and reflective data collected as part of the District Innovation and Action Learning for Health Systems Development (DIALHS) project being implemented in Cape Town, South Africa. Undertaken collaboratively between health managers and researchers, the project is implemented through cycles of action-learning, including systematic reflection and synthesis. It includes a particular focus on how local health managers can better support front line facility managers in strengthening PHC. Results: The results illuminate how the collective understandings of staff working at the primary level - of their working environment and changes within it - act as a barrier to centrally-led initiatives to strengthen PHC. Staff often fail to take ownership of such initiatives and experience them as disempowering. Local area managers, located between the centre and the service frontline, have a vital role to play in providing a leadership of sensemaking to mediate these challenges. Founded on personal values, such leadership entails, for example, efforts to nurture PHC-aligned values and mind-sets among staff; build relationships and support the development of shared meanings about change; instil a culture of collective inquiry and mutual accountability; and role-model management practices, including using language to signal meaning. Conclusions: PHC will only become a lived reality within the South African health system when frontline staff are able to make sense of policy intentions and incorporate them into their everyday routines and practices. This requires a leadership of sensemaking that enables front line staff to exercise their collective discretionary power in strengthening PHC. We hope this theoretically-framed analysis of one set of experiences stimulates wider thinking about the leadership needed to sustain primary health care in other settings.","[Gilson, Lucy] Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, ZA-7708 Cape Town, South Africa; [Gilson, Lucy] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Elloker, Soraya] City Cape Town Dept Hlth, ZA-7785 Mitchells Plain, South Africa; [Olckers, Patti] Lentegeur Hosp, Western Cape Dept Hlth, Klipfontein Mitchells Plain Substruct Off, ZA-7785 Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain, South Africa; [Lehmann, Uta] Univ Western Cape, Sch Publ Hlth, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa","Gilson, L (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Anzio Rd, ZA-7708 Cape Town, South Africa.",lucy.gilson@uct.ac.za,,,,,"Scott V, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P138, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czr020; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Balogun J, 2006, LONG RANGE PLANN, V39, P29, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2005.02.010; Gilson L, 2008, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V23, P294, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czn019; Wastell D, 2010, INT J SOC WELF, V19, P310, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2397.2009.00716.x; Barrett SM, 2004, PUBLIC ADMIN, V82, P249, DOI 10.1111/j.0033-3298.2004.00393.x; Chopra M, 2009, LANCET, V374, P1023, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61122-3; Rouleau L, 2005, J MANAGE STUD, V42, P1413, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00549.x; ARGYRIS C, 1976, ADMIN SCI QUART, V21, P363, DOI 10.2307/2391848; Balogun J, 2003, BRIT J MANAGE, V14, P69, DOI DOI 10.1111/1467-8551.00266; Birken SA, 2012, IMPLEMENT SCI, V7, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-7-28; Brodkin EZ, 2012, PUBLIC ADMIN REV, V72, P940, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02657.x; Buhlungu S, 2007, STATE NATION SOUTH A; CSDH, 2008, FINAL REPORT OF THE; Davis KC, 1969, DISCRETION JUSTICE, P233; Durose C, 2011, POLIT STUD-LONDON, V59, P978, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00886.x; Elloker S, 2013, S AFRICAN HLTH REV 2, P161; Freeman R., 2006, OXFORD HDB PUBLIC PO, P367; Fullan M., 2001, LEADING IN A CULTURE; GCIS, 2012, 2011 CENSUSCAPE TOWN; Ghaye T, 2008, BUILDING THE REFLECTIVE HEALTHCARE ORGANISATION, P1, DOI 10.1002/9780470691809; Gilson L, 2013, INTERNAL REPORT PREP; Green J, 2009, QUALITATIVE METHODS; Kim DH, 1999, INTRODUCTION TO SYST; Lehmann U., 2005, South African Health Review 2005, P136; Lillyman S, 2008, REFLECTIVE PRACTICE, V9, P361, DOI 10.1080/14623940802475827; Lipsky M, 2010, DILEMMAS OF THE INDI; Lipsky M., 1980, STREET LEVEL BUREAUC; Longo F, 2007, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V32, P213; Masilela T, 2001, SOUTH AFRICAN HEALTH, P231; Meadows D.

This study assessed the impact of a place-based ecological learning unit on development of junior high school students' systems thinking skills. It implemented, in a paired pretest-posttest design with 20 students, a qualitative approach using the Repertory Grid-Technique. Qualitative data analysis used the Systems Thinking Hierarchy (STH)-model. Data indicate that most of the students advanced to a higher level within the STH-hierarchy, and developed the ability to generalize ecological phenomena. Findings support that in relation to system thinking, the repertory grid is an effective tool for assessing learners' conceptual models and they broaden the implementation of RG as a research tool to the context of ecological complexity.

Method: Structured standardized quality of life assessment (Manchester Short Quality of Life Assessment: MANSA) was used to establish service user priorities for changes to service provision (part of a process known as check in systems thinking). Current service performance in these priority areas was identified, and changes to service arrangements were planned, implemented and monitored by task and finish (T&F) groups (making use of a process known as flow in systems thinking). Results: 81 MANSA assessments were completed at the check stage (by NM). Work finances and leisure activities emerged as service user priority areas for change, and T&F groups were established with representation of all sectors and service users. Ways to make improvements were observed, planned and implemented by T&F groups (the flow stage). Conclusion: The systems approach reveals how services and quality of life have been changed for patients in Wrexham. Further generalizable research is needed into the potential benefits of using systems thinking in mental health service evaluation.","[Evans, S.; Huxley, P.

The true magnitude of hypertension in some West African countries, including in-depth knowledge of underlying risk factors is not completely understood. There is also a paucity of research on adequate systems-level approaches designed to mitigate the growing burden of hypertension in the region. Aims: In this review, we thematically synthesize available literature pertaining to the prevalence of hypertension in West Africa and discuss factors that influence its diagnosis, treatment and control. We aimed to address the social and structural determinants influencing hypertension in the sub-region including the effects of urbanization, health infrastructure and healthcare workforce. Findings: The prevalence of hypertension in West Africa has increased over the past decade and is rising rapidly with an urban-rural gradient that places higher hypertension prevalence on urban settings compared to rural settings. Overall levels of awareness of one's hypertension status remain consistently low in West African. Structural and economic determinants related to conditions of poverty such as insufficient finances have a direct impact on adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. Urbanization contributes to the increasing incidence of hypertension in the sub-region and available evidence indicates that inadequate health infrastructure may act as a barrier to optimal hypertension control in West Africa. Conclusion: Given that optimal hypertension control in West Africa depends on multiple factors that go beyond simply modifying the behaviors of the individuals alone, we conclude by discussing the potential role systems-thinking approaches can play to achieve optimal control in the sub-region. In the context of recent advances in hypertension management including new therapeutic options and innovative solutions to expand health workforce so as to meet the high demand for healthcare, the success of these strategies will rely on a new understanding of the complexity of human behaviors and interactions most aptly framed from a systems-thinking perspective.","[Iwelunmor, Juliet] Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Airhihenbuwa, Collins O.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biobehav Hlth, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Cooper, Richard; Tayo, Bamidele] Loyola Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Plange-Rhule, Jacob] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Coll Hlth Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Adanu, Richard] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Healthful Behav Change,Div Gen Internal Med, New York, NY USA","Iwelunmor, J (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Kinesiol & Community Hlth, 123 Huff Hall,1206 S Fourth St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",jiwez@illinois.edu,,, [D43TW009140],This work was supported in part by Grant #D43TW009140 (PI: Ogedegbe).,"Adediran O, 2012, J Cardiovasc Dis Res, V3, P191, DOI 10.4103/0975-3583.98890; Agyepong Irene Akua, 2012, Health Policy Plan, V27 Suppl 4, piv20, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs083; Airhihenbuwa C.

Whilst it has made an impact, we argue that we need to be braver, encouraging the approach to evolve and extend its reach. In particular, we need to: extend our conceptualization of what constitutes a system; apply our thinking to a much wider range of complex problems and global challenges; and engage in more predictive work. To illustrate our agenda in novel domains, we provide examples of socio-technical perspectives on the management of crowd events and environmental sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach - The sustainability evaluation of urban tourism is regarded as a multi-level and multi-index evaluation problem in this study. The evaluation index system of urban tourism sustainable development is constructed based on the ideas of holism and systems thinking. Then based on grey system correlation analysis theory, a new evaluation model is proposed to effectively solve the complex and uncertain problems in the sustainability evaluation system of urban tourism. An actual example of the five cities (Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou) in Southern Jiangsu Province of China is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. Findings - The grey comprehensive evaluation model can effectively convert the complex indices into comprehensive optimal membership degrees which are easy to be understood. The empirical study on the urban tourism sustainable development of South of Jiangsu found that: Suzhou, Nanjing and Wuxi were in the basic stage of sustainable development; Changzhou and Zhenjiang were in the preliminary stage of sustainable development. The social responsibility fulfillment of urban tourism in five cities fails to reach a satisfactory level, especially Zhenjiang and Changzhou remain in a low level in fulfillment of social responsibility. Research limitations/implications - Due to the difficulty of data collection, the authors can only use the data on 2010 to do a static evaluation in this study. If the authors can have more data on different years, it is feasible to develop a dynamic evaluation model to analyze the evolution law of the sustainability of urban tourism. Practical implications - The evaluation results provide the necessary support to assist the tourism management departments of the five cities with their policy making. Originality/value - This study not only supplements the evaluation modelling methods widely used in the area of tourism management, but also promotes the development of the grey systems theory itself.","[Wang, Zheng-Xin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ & Int Trade, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Pei, Lingling] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Wang, ZX (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ & Int Trade, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jenkin107@hotmail.com,,,"Academic Climbing Project for Young and Middle-aged Leading Academic in the Universities of Zhejiang Province, China [PD2013275]","The authors thank the Academic Climbing Project for Young and Middle-aged Leading Academic in the Universities of Zhejiang Province, China (Grant No. PD2013275) for financially supporting this study.","Wackernagel M, 1999, ECOL ECON, V29, P375, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)90063-5; Gossling S, 2002, ECOL ECON, V43, P199, DOI 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00211-2; Tseng ML, 2010, EXPERT SYST APPL, V37, P70, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.020; Liou JJH, 2011, TOURISM MANAGE, V32, P1381, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.013; Bramwell B., 1993, J SUSTAIN TOUR, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.1080/09669589309514792; Cater E., 1993, Tourism Management, V14, P85, DOI 10.1016/0261-5177(93)90040-R; Deng J.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Key concepts from systems theory, stakeholder management and social enterprises theories are rethought from the perspective of tourist destination. Main characteristics of the model of community-based organisational structure are identified as well as demands for socially responsible practices and a case study method is used for holistic and in-depth analysis on a real community-based tourism enterprise (CBTE). Findings - The paper proposed innovative socially responsible organisational business model aiming to serve the interests of local community. Interlinking the economic and social objectives in managing the tourist offer on destination level is the critical issue when cooperation of various stakeholders is concerned. Originality/value - The paper provides new insight on organising the tourism offer in the destination by using CBTE model. Findings might give impetus for new lines of research oriented on socially sustainable organisational models for responsible destinations.

The aim of this research is to analyse and discuss the application of 2.0 systems thinking (ST) in three countries (France, UK and Serbia) to promote sustainable tourism thinking. Design/methodology/approach - Online tourism ads available on YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion, related to the cultural contexts of the UK, France and Serbia, have been analysed through a qualitative approach based on the use of visual methods. Furthermore, sustainable tourism dimensions and discourses have been identified in each context by applying intra- and intertextual analysis. Findings - The results show that the use of 2.0 ST to promote sustainable tourism should take into account environmental and socio-cultural issues in each cultural context. These findings show that both the UK and France promote sustainable tourism logic through applying a 2.0 ST. This is not the case with Serbia where online sustainable tourism videos are underrepresented and the online content is different from the one in the UK and France. Research limitations/implications - This research might help tourism researchers and professionals to understand cultural differences when promoting sustainable tourism through a 2.0 communication and online videos. The results show that tourism system has to be considered as a complex and a dynamic framework where intense interlinking of social media with political, cultural, promotional, and organizational aspects of tourism systems in different countries is present. Practical implications - The proposed framework in this study represents a tool that will enable tourism professionals to improve their sustainable tourism communication, especially the environmental and socio-cultural dimensions when considering a 2.0 communication approach. Originality/value - The original aspect of this research is related to the analysis of interactive videos in tourism studies and to the introduction of a new framework based on 2.0 ST, used to promote sustainable tourism in a cross-cultural context.","[Batat, Wided; Prentovic, Sonja] Univ Lyon 2, Lyon, France","Batat, W (reprint author), Univ Lyon 2, Lyon, France.",wided.batat@yahoo.fr,,,,,"Mayaka M, 2007, TOURISM MANAGE, V28, P298, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2005.12.023; Budeanu A, 2007, INT J CONSUM STUD, V31, P499, DOI 10.1111/j.1470-6431.2007.00606.x; [Anonymous], 2002, INT C RESP TOUR DEST; Jackson MC, 2001, EUR J OPER RES, V128, P233, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(00)00067-9; Cabrera D, 2008, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V31, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.12.001; Kapsali M, 2011, INT J PROJ MANAG, V29, P396, DOI 10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.01.003; Kietzmann JH, 2011, BUS HORIZONS, V54, P241, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2011.01.005; Kim J, 2012, MEDIA CULT SOC, V34, P53, DOI 10.1177/0163443711427199; Berthon PR, 2012, BUS HORIZONS, V55, P261, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2012.01.007; Buhalis D, 2000, TOURISM MANAGE, V21, P97, DOI 10.1016/S0261-5177(99)00095-3; Tussyadiah IP, 2009, ANN TOURISM RES, V36, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2008.10.001; Woodside AG, 2009, J TRAVEL RES, V48, P205, DOI 10.1177/0047287509332335; Baumgartner C, 2012, ASPEC TOUR, P166; Belk R.

Drawing on ideas from critical systems thinking and critical systems heuristics, an evaluation framework with a pro-equity focus is suggested. The framework addresses issues of complexity. It invites theories of change associated with philosophical ethics, and provides a means of surfacing and potentially transforming debilitating relations of power in a complex evaluand. A case study of the long-standing Narmada project in India is used to sketch the workings of the framework.

Although this is demanding, a greater challenge for all sectors is climate change. However, the three options to comply with sulphur regulation do little to address this challenge. With a deep-seated change to the type of fuel burnt in marine engines, this should be seen as an opportunity to explore co-benefits of sulphur and carbon reduction - instead of taking a short-sighted approach to the problem. It is argued here that the upcoming sulphur regulations should be postponed and instead, a co-ordinated suite of regulations should be implemented that tackles cumulative CO2 emissions and localised SOx emissions in chorus. This would ensure that less developed, yet more radical, step-change forms of propulsion such as wind, battery and biofuels are introduced from the outset - reducing the risks of infrastructure lock-in and preventing the lock-out of technologies that can meaningfully reduce absolute emissions from the sector.

Such an approach is structured by context-driven enquiry, supported by learning power, positioned at the interface of knowledge generation and use, and grounded in a commitment to sustainable development. Rather than beginning with pre-defined abstract subject knowledge, the students begin with an engineering problem in a particular territory or a place, and develop a systems architecture, a holistic way of defining that territory, which facilitates synergy as well as analysing performance. In order to do this, students need to be able to uncover the different knowledge systems through which their territory can be perceived and known, and explore the different parameters and measurements which can be applied to them. Such 'systems architecting' cannot be achieved through rote learning or the cognitive application of pre-defined knowledge, since by definition the solution to the problem to be solved cannot be known in advance. Rather it depends on the ability to learn, and to progress through an open-ended, formative, dynamic learning process. It is framed by a selected purpose, fuelled by learning power (including creativity, meaning making, curiosity and resilience) and co-generated through knowledge structuring processes. It begins with experience and observation and concludes with a product which is a unique application of knowledge for a particular engineering purpose. One of the challenges of technology enhanced learning is how to integrate learning design in an architectural framework which leverages mobile, social and 'big' data to enhance the processes and social relationships of learning, rather than simply providing information or evaluating outcomes. The approach presented in this paper outlines what can be understood as learning design principles' which support the development of semantic web applications, through the application of learning power and knowledge structuring processes. A pilot study demonstrates that students who successfully undertook an assignment requiring the development of a systems architecture increased in the strategic awareness-a key dimension of learning power. This small pilot study makes a contribution to the debate about the education of Chartered Engineers characterised ""by their ability to develop appropriate solutions to engineering problems, using new or existing technologies, through innovation, creativity and change"" (UK Engineering Council)","[Godfrey, P.] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Syst Ctr, Fac Engn, Bristol BS8 1UB, Avon, England; [Crick, R.

Charitable lotteries are often portrayed as good works', and recently, hospitals have utilized them as a popular fundraising vehicle to raise necessary funds to help achieve organizational goals and objectives. Research indicates that lotteries contribute to gambling-related harms; however, research into charitable lotteries has been underdeveloped. Both the gambling and the health care industries are complex and evolving, consisting of many interacting stakeholders with often different and competing interests. This article seeks to present systems thinking as a conceptual framework to help fill the gap in understanding the use of gambling within hospitals and its possible benefits and unforeseen negative consequences. Addressing the gap in knowledge is important to help inform decision making aimed at reducing gambling-related harms. MethodThis article proposes how the school of systems thinking, specifically framing hospitals as complex adaptive systems and system dynamics modelling, can be utilized to understand the policy implications of the adoption of lotteries as a revenue source for hospitals. ConclusionHospitals have a duty to care, inform and protect. Hospital charitable lotteries have become big business; however, its incorporation into critical funding strategies needs to be carefully understood. Systems thinking theory and methodologies provide an integrated approach to examine this dynamic and evolving fundraising initiative. Findings from this article can inform the development of action strategies, including policy development at multiple levels.","[Reynolds, Jennifer] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada","Reynolds, J (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Hlth Sci Bldg,155 Coll St Rm 500, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada.",jennifer.reynolds@utoronto.ca,,,Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) Doctoral Fellowship Awards,"Jennifer Reynolds is a doctoral candidate at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, and was supported through the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) Doctoral Fellowship Awards.","Adams P., 2006, J GAMBLING ISSUES, V17, DOI 10.4309/jgi.2006.17.1; Adams PJ, 2008, ROUTL STUD SOC POLIT, V53, P1; Alvesson M., 1996, HDB ORG STUDIES, P191; Hoard M, 2005, INT J HYG ENVIR HEAL, V208, P117, DOI 10.1016/j.ijheh.2005.01.011; Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; Galea S, 2009, INT J DRUG POLICY, V20, P209, DOI 10.1016/j.drugpo.2008.08.005; Jones AP, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P488, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.063529; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Topolski S, 2009, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V15, P749, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01227.x; Bandura A, 2004, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V31, P143, DOI 10.1177/1090198104263660; Chaerul M, 2008, WASTE MANAGE, V28, P442, DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2007.01.007; Cabrera D, 2008, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V31, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.12.001; Petry NM, 2003, ADDICTION, V98, P645, DOI 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00336.x; [Anonymous], 2010, LOTTERY GAMBLING REV; Norman CD, 2009, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V15, P868, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01273.x; McDaniel RR, 2009, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V34, P191, DOI 10.1097/HMR.0b013e31819c8b38; Adams PJ, 2007, ADDICTION, V102, P1027, DOI 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01829.x; Hardoon KK, 2001, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V57, P749, DOI 10.1002/jclp.1047; Ariyabuddhiphongs V., 2006, INT GAMBL STUD, V6, P77, DOI 10.1080/14459790600644218; Azmier J., 2000, ETHICS CHARITABLE GA; Baranowski T., 2002, HLTH BEHAV HLTH ED T, P165; Barnes M., 2003, EVALUATION, V9, P265, DOI 10.1177/13563890030093003; Canadian Partnership for Responsible Gambling, 2010, CAN GAMBL DIG 2008 2; Cosgrave J., 2009, CASINO STATE LEGALIZ; Frost R O, 2001, J Gambl Stud, V17, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1016636214258; Griffiths M., 2001, INT GAMBLING STUDIES, V1, P27, DOI [10.1080/14459800108732286, DOI 10.1080/14459800108732286]; Hraba J, 1990, J Gambl Stud, V6, P355, DOI 10.1007/BF01014590; Industry information/lottery industry [database on the Internet], 2009, SCI GAM; Jackson M.

This study has two main objectives. The first is to conceptualize the wider range of effects of task shifting through a systems thinking lens. The second is to explore these effects using task shifting for HIV in Burkina Faso as a case study. Methods: We used a case study approach, using qualitative research methods. Data sources included document reviews, reviews of available data and records, as well as interviews with key informants and health workers. Results: In addition to the traditional measures of impact of task shifting on health outcomes, our study identified 20 possible effects of the strategy on the system as a whole. Moreover, our analysis highlighted the importance of differentiating between two types of health systems effects. The first are effects inherent to the task shifting strategy itself, such as job satisfaction or better access to health services. The second are effects due to health system barriers, for example the unavailability of medicines and supplies, generating a series of effects on the various components of the health system, e. g., staff frustration. Among the health systems effects that we found are positive, mostly unintended, effects and synergies such as increased health workers' sense of responsibility and worthiness, increased satisfaction due to using the newly acquired skills in other non-HIV tasks, as well as improved patient-provider relationships. Among the negative unintended effects are staff frustration due to lack of medicines and supplies or lack of the necessary infrastructure to be able to perform the new tasks. Conclusion: Our analysis highlights the importance of adopting a systems thinking approach in designing, implementing and evaluating health policies to mitigate some of the design issues or system bottle-necks that may impede their successful implementation or risk to present an incomplete or misleading picture of their impact.","[Bocoum, Fadima Yaya; Kouanda, Seni] Inst Rech Sci Sante, Dept Biomed & Sante Publ, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Bocoum, Fadima Yaya] Univ Western Cape, Sch Publ Hlth, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kouyate, Bocar] Minist Hlth, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Hounton, Sennen] UN, Populat Fund, Tech Div, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Adam, Taghreed] WHO, Alliance Hlth Policy & Syst Res, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Adam, T (reprint author), WHO, Alliance Hlth Policy & Syst Res, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",adamt@who.int,,,Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research at the World Health Organization,This work was supported by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research at the World Health Organization.,"Agyepong IA, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P20, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs083; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P1, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs084; Bedelu M, 2007, J INFECT DIS, V196, pS464, DOI 10.1086/521114; Curry LA, 2009, CIRCULATION, V119, P1442, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.742775; Kidane G, 2000, LANCET, V356, P550, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02580-0; Adam T, 2012, HEALTH POLICY PLANN, V27, P9, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czs086; Zachariah R, 2009, T ROY SOC TROP MED H, V103, P549, DOI 10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.09.019; De Brouwere V, 2009, REPROD HEALTH MATTER, V17, P32, DOI 10.1016/S0968-8080(09)33437-0; Assefa Y, 2009, PLOS MED, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000056; Callaghan M, 2010, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V8, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-8-8; Centre National de Lute contre le Sida, 2012, RAPP SER 2011 SIT SE; Conseil National de Lutte contre le Sida et le IST, 2010, ACC UN PREV TRAIT PR; DeSavigny D, 2009, SYSTEMS THINKING FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, P1; Futures Group HPI, 2010, CREAT EN ENV TASK SH; Gaye PA, 2009, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V7, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-7-2; Gimbel-Sherr S, 2007, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V28, P7; Hounton SH, 2008, AIDS CARE, V20, P582, DOI 10.1080/09540120701868303; Hounton SH, 2009, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V7, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-7-34; Kouanda S, 2010, AIDS CARE, V22, P1146, DOI 10.1080/09540121003605047; Lehmann U, 2009, HUM RESOUR HEALTH, V7, DOI 10.1186/1478-4491-7-49; McPake B, 2008, LANCET, V372, P870, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61375-6; Ministere de la sante, 2010, PLAN ACT 2010 MIN SA; Nabudere N, 2010, EVIDENCE BASED POLIC; Paina L, 2011, HLTH POLICY PLAN, V27, P1; Sherr K, 2009, JAIDS-J ACQ IMM DEF, V52, pS20, DOI 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181bbc9c0; Traore A, 2011, GLOB HEALTH PROMOT, V18, P20, DOI 10.1177/1757975911422961; UNAIDS (United Nations & AIDS), 2010, UNAIDS REP GLOB AIDS; Walsh A, 2010, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-10-272; WHO, 2007, EV BUS STRENGTH HLTH; World Health Organization, 2006, WORLD HLTH REP 2006; World Health Organization, 2006, TUB, P1",31,4,4,5,5,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,22-Oct,2013,13,,,,,,,,997,10.1186/1471-2458-13-997,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",284AU,WOS:000329289200005,J,"Florin, MJ; van Ittersum, MK; van de Ven, GWJ",,,,"Florin, Madeleine J.; van Ittersum, Martin K.; van de Ven, Gerrie W.

The Brazilian government has been promoting the role of family farmers as producers of biomass for biodiesel since 2004; however, fewer than expected family farmers have decided to produce biomass for biodiesel. The North of Minas Gerais is one region where a biodiesel plant has been strategically located to source castor beans grown by family farmers. The target family farm type in this region specializes in beef and/or dairy production with low input pasture (approximately 30 ha per farm), maize intercropped with beans (approximately 1 ha per farm) and sugarcane (approximately 1 ha per farm). We selected this region for a case study to explore management decisions of farmers, industry and policy makers that influence family farmer engagement with biodiesel production through cultivation of castor beans. To evaluate outcomes for family farmers engaging with the PNPB, we focused on how cultivation of castor beans impacts family farmers in terms of income levels, income stability and levels of milk production. We used an application of systems thinking known as Bayesian network modelling (BNM). BNM was chosen for its suitability to integrate different types of knowledge and to include quantitative and qualitative variables. The study was built on a body of scientific literature explaining why family farmers have not been cultivating castor beans for biodiesel production and a body of experiential knowledge of local actors (farmers, extension officers, policy makers, biodiesel manufacturers and researchers in North of Minas Gerais). The complete BNM consisted of a 'cause and effect' diagram where the strengths of the causal relationships were quantified with elicited opinions from surveyed local actors. We used the complete BNM to explore scenarios that could improve outcomes for family farmers and consequently increase their level of engagement. For example, we addressed subsidy structures of the PNPB, crop management, farm-level trade-offs and value-chain innovations. We demonstrate that decisions to support family farmer engagement with biodiesel are not singular. Engagement by family farmers requires simultaneously: improvements in technical crop management, reductions in farm-level cash constraints and innovations in the production chain such that engagement of family farmers goes beyond cultivation of one more low-value crop. Finally we discuss some methodological issues from this application of BNM to farming systems research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Strong and effective health systems are increasingly considered a prerequisite to reducing the disease burden and to achieving the health MDGs. Zambia is one of the countries that are lagging behind in achieving millennium development targets. Several barriers have been identified as hindering the progress towards health related millennium development goals. Designing an intervention that addresses these barriers was crucial and so the Better Health Outcomes through Mentorship (BHOMA) project was designed to address the challenges in the Zambia's MOH using a system wide approach. We applied systems thinking approach to describe the baseline status of the Six WHO building blocks for health system strengthening. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted looking at the status of the Six WHO building blocks for health systems strengthening in three BHOMA districts. We conducted Focus group discussions with community members and In-depth Interviews with key informants. Data was analyzed using Nvivo version 9. Results: The study showed that building block specific weaknesses had cross cutting effect in other health system building blocks which is an essential element of systems thinking. Challenges noted in service delivery were linked to human resources, medical supplies, information flow, governance and finance building blocks either directly or indirectly. Several barriers were identified as hindering access to health services by the local communities. These included supply side barriers: Shortage of qualified health workers, bad staff attitude, poor relationships between community and health staff, long waiting time, confidentiality and the gender of health workers. Demand side barriers: Long distance to health facility, cost of transport and cultural practices. Participating communities seemed to lack the capacity to hold health workers accountable for the drugs and services. Conclusion: The study has shown that building block specific weaknesses had cross cutting effect in other health system building blocks. These linkages emphasised the need to use system wide approaches in assessing the performance of health system strengthening interventions.","[Mutale, Wilbroad] Univ Zambia, Sch Med, Dept Community Med, Lusaka, Zambia; [Mutale, Wilbroad; Ayles, Helen] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, Dept Clin Res, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Bond, Virginia; Mwanamwenge, Margaret Tembo; Mlewa, Susan; Ayles, Helen] Univ Zambia, ZAMBART Project, Lusaka, Zambia; [Balabanova, Dina; Spicer, Neil] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1H 9SH, England","Mutale, W (reprint author), Univ Zambia, Sch Med, Dept Community Med, Lusaka, Zambia.",wmutale@yahoo.com,,,The ministry of Health in Zambia; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation,The authors would like to thank the following:; The ministry of Health in Zambia for the support rendered to the BHOMA project.; The study was funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

Traditional and reductionist approaches have shown their inability to address sustainability issues. Increasing complex issues and challenges related to sustainability requires a fresh approach to address the multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary nature of complexity. In this paper, systems thinking is used in a case study in a UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve to demonstrate its application to effectively address complex and sustainability issues. A systems model has been developed, and various tools, processes and techniques of systems thinking have been used in the study. The systems model and its associated systems archetypes are qualitatively analysed to provide insights into potential system behaviour and to facilitate the identification of leverage points and systemic intervention strategies that are required for the sustainable development of the Biosphere. The unique approach used in this study has significant potential to apply globally considering the comprehensive network of Biosphere Reserves around the world, as well as the various sustainability and other complex issues that our society is facing.

Cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia are believed to result from hypofunction of the mesocortical dopaminergic projections to prefrontal cortex (PFC). Noradrenergic targets for the augmentation of dopaminergic function in PFC show promise to improve cognitive deficits as well as negative symptoms. Serotonergic targets for the modulation of mesocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission include 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors. The hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. L-DOPA, a metabolic precursor of dopamine, is the standard of treatment. However, the ectopic release of dopamine (DA) from serotonin neurons and the clearance of extracellular DA by the norepinephrine transporter in areas enriched with noradrenergic terminals contribute to extracellular DA produced by L-DOPA and offer opportunities to improve L-DOPA therapy. The high-affinity transporters for monoamines are the primary targets for antidepressant drugs. However, many patients experience suboptimal therapeutic benefit or fail to respond to treatment. Organic cation transporters and plasma membrane monoamine transporter serve an important function in regulating monoamine neurotransmission and hold potential utility as targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. Improved therapeutic approaches will arise from not only understanding how monoamines influence one another within the central nervous system as an integrated whole but also addressing the pathophysiology of specific core symptoms or distinct syndromal dimensions (cognitive impairment, motor slowing, and negative affect) regardless of disease classification, for example, psychotic, affective, and neurodegenerative.","[Hensler, Julie G.; Daws, Lynette C.; Koek, Wouter] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Pharmacol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Artigas, Francesc; Bortolozzi, Analia] IIBB CSIC IDIBAPS, Dept Neurochem & Neuropharmacol, Barcelona, Spain; [Artigas, Francesc; Bortolozzi, Analia] ISCIII, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain; [Bortolozzi, Analia] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; [Daws, Lynette C.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Physiol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [De Deurwaerdere, Philippe; Milan, Lea; Navailles, Sylvia] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5293, Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Bordeaux, France; [Koek, Wouter] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Psychiat, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA","Hensler, JG (reprint author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Pharmacol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA.",hensler@uthscsa.edu,,,,,"Bishop C, 2012, EUR J NEUROSCI, V36, P2839, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08202.x; Daws LC, 2009, PHARMACOL THERAPEUT, V121, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.10.004; Navailles S, 2010, NEUROBIOL DIS, V38, P136, DOI 10.1016/j.nbd.2010.01.012; Goldman-Rakic PS, 2000, BRAIN RES REV, V31, P295, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00045-4; Rappold PM, 2011, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V108, P20766, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1115141108; Horton RE, 2013, J NEUROSCI, V33, P10534, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5687-11.2013; Baganz NL, 2008, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V105, P18976, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0800466105; Lindgren HS, 2010, J NEUROCHEM, V112, P1465, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06556.x; Jodo E, 1998, NEUROSCIENCE, V83, P63, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4522(97)00372-2; Carr DB, 2000, J NEUROSCI, V20, P3864; Vijayraghavan S, 2007, NAT NEUROSCI, V10, P376, DOI 10.1038/nn1846; Williams GV, 2006, NEUROSCIENCE, V139, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.09.028; Dahlin A, 2007, NEUROSCIENCE, V146, P1193, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.01.072; Cui M, 2009, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V106, P8043, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0900358106; Bortolozzi A, 2010, INT J NEUROPSYCHOPH, V13, P1299, DOI 10.1017/S146114571000009X; Engel K, 2005, MOL PHARMACOL, V68, P1397, DOI 10.1124/mol.105.016832; Munoz A, 2008, BRAIN, V131, P3380, DOI 10.1093/brain/awn235; Navailles S, 2011, NEUROBIOL DIS, V41, P585, DOI 10.1016/j.nbd.2010.11.007; Artigas F, 2010, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V121, P11, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01455.x; Cragg SJ, 2004, TRENDS NEUROSCI, V27, P270, DOI 10.1016/j.tins.2004.03.011; Skolnick P, 2006, CNS DRUG REV, V12, P123, DOI 10.1111/j.1527-3458.2006.00123.x; Bacq A, 2012, MOL PSYCHIATR, V17, P926, DOI 10.1038/mp.2011.87; Bjorkholm C, 2013, EUR NEUROPSYCHOPHARM, V23, P709, DOI 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.05.012; Diaz-Mataix L, 2005, J NEUROSCI, V25, P10831, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2999-05.2005; Fox MA, 2007, NEUROPHARMACOLOGY, V53, P643, DOI 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2007.07.009; Fahn S, 2008, MOVEMENT DISORD, V23, pS497, DOI 10.1002/mds.22028; Daws LC, 2013, ACS CHEM NEUROSCI, V4, P16, DOI 10.1021/cn3001872; Karreman M, 1996, J NEUROCHEM, V66, P589; Bunin MA, 1999, TRENDS NEUROSCI, V22, P377, DOI 10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01410-1; Engel K, 2004, J BIOL CHEM, V279, P50042, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M407913200; Masana M, 2012, CURR TOP MED CHEM, V12, P2357; Stone EA, 2008, EUR J PHARMACOL, V580, P135, DOI 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.10.045; Koepsell H, 2007, PHARM RES, V24, P1227, DOI 10.1007/s11095-9254-z; Aston-Jones G., 2004, RAT NERVOUS SYSTEM, P183; Baganz N, 2010, J NEUROSCI, V30, P15185, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2740-10.2010; Bjorklund A., 1986, HDB PHYSL NERVOUS SY, VIV, P677; Bortolozzi A, 2005, J NEUROCHEM, V95, P1597, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03485.x; Celada P., 2007, MONOAMINERGIC MODULA, P197; Duan H., 2012, J BIOL CHEM, V288, P3535; Eisenhofer G, 2001, PHARMACOL THERAPEUT, V91, P35, DOI 10.1016/S0163-7258(01)00144-9; Eskow Jaunarajs Karen L, 2011, Neurosci Biobehav Rev, V35, P556, DOI 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.06.007; Feng N, 2010, BRAIN RES, V1326, P105, DOI 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.02.044; Gasser P.

But as for must business, the tools may be important, but the vision and the strategy to use these tools are much more important. Therefore the chapter discusses e-Government and e-Procurement in their strategic contexts, in which intelligence (contextual integrated information) is a key factor to survive. The reason is because the government is a Complex Adaptive System (CAS). Without intelligence and the agility of its structure and processes, the government will not survive, or at least it will be less efficient and effective in developing strategies and in executing these strategies. The game theory discussion will show that the flexibility and agility of the e-Procurement system (together with a good strategy) are key factors for a successful system; otherwise e-Procurement is more of weakness in the government's value chain of procurement of goods and services. In the last part of the discussion on Cloud Computing and e-Procurement, the author argues that ERP systems (so called best practices) are not well adapted to other contexts than the simple context of the Cynefin Framework. Service Oriented Architecture solutions can provide better (adapted) solutions for e-Procurement. Cloud Computing in combination with SOA may be the next generation solution.","Univ Hasselt, Diepenbeek, Belgium","Rabaey, M (reprint author), Univ Hasselt, Diepenbeek, Belgium.",,,,,,"Ariely D, 2009, PREDICTABLY IRRATION; Bernard H., 1976, TOTALE OORLOG REVOLU, VI; Berryman J.

The authors propose that CBPR can benefit from a systems science framework to represent the complex and dynamic characteristics of a community and identify intervention points and potential ""tipping points."" Systems science refers to a field of study that posits a holistic framework that is focused on component parts of a system in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems. Systems thinking tools can assist in intervention planning by allowing all CBPR stakeholders to visualize how community factors are interrelated and by potentially identifying the most salient intervention points. To demonstrate the potential utility of systems science tools in CBPR, the authors show the use of causal loop diagrams by a community coalition engaged in CBPR activities regarding youth drinking reduction and prevention.","[BeLue, Rhonda] Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","BeLue, R (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rzb10@psu.edu,,,,,"Mabry PL, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, pS211, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.018; Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; Rahmandad H, 2008, MANAGE SCI, V54, P998, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1070.0787; Green LW, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P406, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066035; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Resnicow K, 2008, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V98, P1382, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2007.129460; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; Burke JG, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P1392, DOI 10.1177/1049732305278876; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; KELDER SH, 1994, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V84, P1121, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.84.7.1121; Cabrera D, 2008, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V31, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.12.001; Wallerstein N, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, pS40, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2009.184036; Israel BA, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, P2094, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2009.170506; Trochim W, 2005, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V17, P187, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzi038; Mabry PL, 2010, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V100, P1161, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2010.198176; Anderson RA, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P669, DOI 10.1177/1049732305275208; Bentley ME, 1998, AIDS, V12, P1869, DOI 10.1097/00002030-199814000-00019; Cavana RY, 2004, SYST DYNAM REV, V20, P223, DOI 10.1002/sdr.294; Dinno A, 2008, SOC SCI MED, V66, P1448, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.12.032; FORRESTER JW, 1994, SYST DYNAM REV, V10, P245, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260100211; FORRESTER JW, 1968, MANAGE SCI, V14, P398, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.14.7.398; Fredericks KA, 2008, AM J EVAL, V29, P251, DOI 10.1177/1098214008319446; Gaventa J, 2002, CURRENTS, V28, P29; Holland J.

These questions guided a knowledge synthesis using a novel 'rapid review' methodology. The synthesis used complex adaptive systems as a theoretical lens, in collaboration with an international expert panel. Findings strengthen the call for a systems paradigm in public health, extending theoretical propositions to empirical studies of knowledge generation and use.","[Riley, Barbara] Univ Waterloo, Propel Ctr Populat Hlth Impact, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Norman, Cameron D.] CENSE Res Design, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Best, Allan] InSource Res Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Riley, B (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Propel Ctr Populat Hlth Impact, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",briley@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,"Almeida Celia, 2006, Cad Saude Publica, V22 Suppl, pS7; Best A, 2010, EVID POLICY, V6, P145, DOI 10.1332/174426410X502284; Dzewaltowski DA, 2004, ANN BEHAV MED, V28, P75, DOI 10.1207/s15324796abm2802_1; Hawe P, 2009, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V43, P267, DOI 10.1007/s10464-009-9229-9; Klesges LM, 2005, ANN BEHAV MED, V29, P66, DOI 10.1207/s15324796abm2902s_10; Botvin GJ, 2004, PREV SCI, V5, P69, DOI 10.1023/B:PREV.0000013984.83251.8b; Lavis JN, 2003, MILBANK Q, V81, P221, DOI 10.1111/1468-0009.t01-1-00052; Green LW, 2001, AM J HEALTH BEHAV, V25, P165; Dobrow MJ, 2004, SOC SCI MED, V58, P207, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00166-7; Swinburn B, 2005, OBES REV, V6, P23, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2005.00184.x; Greenhalgh T, 2004, MILBANK Q, V82, P581, DOI 10.1111/j.0887-378X.2004.00325.x; Chinman M, 2005, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V35, P143, DOI 10.1007/s10464-005-3390-6; Greenhalgh T, 2005, SOC SCI MED, V61, P417, DOI 10.1016/j.soscimed.2004.12.001; Trochim WM, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P538, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066001; Briss PA, 2004, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V25, P281, DOI 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.050503.153933; Trickett EJ, 2011, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V101, P1410, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2010.300113; Sterman JD, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P505, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066043; Best A, 2008, PATIENT EDUC COUNS, V71, P319, DOI 10.1016/j.pec.2008.02.013; Bammer G, 2005, ECOL SOC, V10; Hawkins JD, 2002, ADDICT BEHAV, V27, P951, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4603(02)00298-8; Kerner JF, 2005, CANCER CAUSE CONTROL, V16, P27, DOI 10.1007/s10552-005-0488-y; Green LW, 2006, EVAL HEALTH PROF, V29, P126, DOI 10.1177/0163278705284445; Pang T, 2003, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V81, P815; Sandler I, 2005, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V35, P127, DOI 10.1007/s10464-005-3389-z; Biglan A, 2004, PREV SCI, V5, P15, DOI 10.1023/B:PREV.0000013977.07261.5a; Trickett EJ, 2011, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V101, P1353, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300124; Cundill GNR, 2005, ECOL SOC, V10; McGinnis JM, 2001, AM J HEALTH PROMOT, V15, P391; Kitson AL, 2009, J ADV NURS, V65, P217, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04864.x; Robinson K, 2005, HEALTH EDUC RES, V20, P499, DOI 10.1093/her/cyh006; Miller RL, 2005, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V35, P169, DOI 10.1007/s10464-005-3395-1; Arksey H, 2005, INT J SOC RES METHOD, V8, P19, DOI DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616; Barnes M., 2003, EVALUATION, V9, P265, DOI 10.1177/13563890030093003; Bar-Yam Y, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P459, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.064444; Best A, 2011, TRANSL BEHAV MED, V1, P361, DOI 10.1007/s13142-011-0050-2; Best A., 2008, SYSTEMS THINKING KNO; Bowen S, 2005, PLOS MED, V2, P600, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020166; Bradley EH, 2004, ISSUE BRIEF COMMONW, V724, P1; Briss PA, 2005, LANCET, V365, P828, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71019-9; Cameron R., 2007, 1 CTR BEH RES PROGR; Champagne Francois, 2004, USING KNOWLEDGE EVID; Dooley Kevin J., 1997, NONLINEAR DYNAMICS P, V1, p[69, 42], DOI 10.1023/A:1022375910940; Edwards N., 2007, WHOLE SYSTEMS CHANGE; Etheredge LM, 2007, HEALTH AFFAIR, V26, pW107, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.26.2.w107; Glasgow RE, 2003, DIABETES CARE, V26, P2451, DOI 10.2337/diacare.26.8.2451; Glouberman Sholom, 2006, Aust Health Rev, V30, P7; Green LW, 1996, CAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V87, pS11; Greenhalgh T., 2011, BMC RES METHODOLOGY, V16, P115; Greenhalgh T., 2012, BRIT J GEN PRACTICE, P371; Gunderson L.H., 1995, BARRIERS BROKEN BRID; Herbert C, 2011, HEALTHCARE PAPERS, V2, P31; Highfield R., 1995, FRONTIERS COMPLEXITY; Innvaer Simon, 2002, J Health Serv Res Policy, V7, P239, DOI 10.1258/135581902320432778; Kerner JF, 2006, J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH, V26, P72, DOI 10.1002/chp.53; Kitson A, 2008, SPEEDING SPREAD PUTT; Leischow SJ, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, pS196, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.014; Lin V, 2004, SOZ PRAVENTIV MED, V49, P179, DOI 10.1007/s00038-004-3083-1; Maxwell J.

Many politically consequential system effects are not amenable to research designs that meet these standards, yet they must nonetheless be studied if the most important questions of international politics are to be answered. For example, if nuclear weapons are considered in light of their effect on the international system as a whole, it becomes clear that they have obviated the need for a global balance of power by allowing states to counterbalance threats by acquiring nuclear weapons rather than investing in massive conventional balancing efforts. Similarly, systems thinking should inform our understanding of the impact of a unipolar power such as the United States, which has enjoyed an overwhelming preponderance of conventional military power since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A unipolar power is likely to become involved in frequent conflicts because it is not restrained by the presence of a peer competitor.","Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Monteiro, NP (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 115 Prospect St,Rosenkranz Hall, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",nuno.monteiro@yale.edu,,,,,"Posen BR, 2003, INT SECURITY, V28, P5, DOI 10.1162/016228803322427965; Monteiro NP, 2009, INT THEOR, V1, P15, DOI 10.1017/S1752971909000050; Pouliot V, 2008, INT ORGAN, V62, P257, DOI 10.1017/S0020818308080090; Powell R, 2006, INT ORGAN, V60, P169, DOI 10.1017/S0020818306060061; Nexon DH, 2009, WORLD POLIT, V61, P330, DOI 10.1017/S0043887109000124; MORROW JD, 1994, J CONFLICT RESOLUT, V38, P270, DOI 10.1177/0022002794038002005; Jackson PT, 1999, EUR J INT RELAT, V5, P291, DOI 10.1177/1354066199005003002; Wohlforth WC, 1999, INT SECURITY, V24, P5, DOI 10.1162/016228899560031; Barkin J.

Methods of research include analysis of numerical data, statistical findings by research and development groups (RAND), Department of Defense system acquisition reports, and application of the developed model to a relevant program. A systems thinking approach to cost growth behavior analysis provides decision-makers with a holistic understanding of cause, effect and reaction in order to more realistically estimate cost growth.

Methods: This study reports on curriculum development and evaluation of a 3-day, clinically oriented patient safety intersession that was implemented at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in January 2011. Using simulation, skills demonstrations, small group exercises and case studies, this intersession focuses on improving students' teamwork and communication skills and system-based thinking while teaching on the causes of preventable harm and evidence-based strategies for harm prevention. One hundred and twenty students participated in this intersession as part of their required second year curriculum. A preepost assessment of students' safety knowledge, self-efficacy in safety skills and system-based thinking was conducted. Student satisfaction data were also collected. Results: Students' safety knowledge scores significantly improved (mean +19% points; 95% CI 17.0 to 21.6; p<0.01). Composite system thinking scores increased from a mean pre-intersession score of 60.1 to a post-intersession score of 67.6 (p<0.01). Students had statistically significant increases in self-efficacy for all taught communication and safety skills. Participant satisfaction with the intersession was high. Conclusions: The patient safety intersession resulted in increased knowledge, system-based thinking, and self-efficacy scores among students. Similar intersessions can be implemented at medical, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health schools separately or jointly as part of required school curricula. Further study of the long-term impact of such education on knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours of students is warranted.","[Aboumatar, Hanan J.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Internal Med, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA;

This two-part essay proposes new answers to both questions. It reaches out to the wider community of OR professionals and explains from their perspective what CST is all about and why it matters for good practice. Part 1 first reviews the idea and history of systems thinking in OR, as a basis for properly situating CST within OR. It then offers a comparative, non-partisan account of the two strands of CST, critical systems heuristics and total systems intervention, and identifies their combined potential in an ability to enhance the contextual sophistication of OR. The prevalent but inaccurate notion of the history of OR as a linear evolution from 'hard' to 'soft' and 'critical' systems thinking is replaced by an integrated perspective of OR as applied systems thinking.

Further, it identified the contribution of 'critical' systems thinking (CST) in a combined ability of its two strands, critical systems heuristics (CSH) and total systems intervention (TSI), to enhance the conceptual sophistication of OR. Part 2 aims to translate this understanding into a framework for good professional practice. How exactly can CST strengthen the competence profile of OR professionals? Drawing on three experience-based archetypes of professional service and some basic argumentation-theoretical considerations, a new understanding of OR and applied systems thinking as argumentative practice emerges. In this new understanding CST finds a systematic place and some exemplary uses of CSH and TSI can be located-an integrated perspective.

Their effective development and deployment is at the basis of organizational value creation capacity. However there is still a lack of applied approaches and tools explaining how knowledge assets dynamics take place in organizational value creation mechanisms. In particular, there is a managerial need to define decision-support frameworks that can enable managers to understand how knowledge assets interact each other and with organizational performance in order to support the achievement of company's strategic objectives. A better understanding of why and how knowledge assets management initiatives can be turned into value creation mechanisms with positive impacts on business performance is fundamental to avoid misallocation of resources and to support management decisions. This paper proposes a systems thinking-based framework, the Knowledge Assets Dynamics Value Map (KAVDM), to explicate the working mechanisms by means knowledge assets can evolve on the basis of knowledge management initiatives and affect business performance improvements. The KAVDM offers a holistic view of the mechanisms at the basis of how knowledge assets are translated into organizational value. It supports the explanation and monitoring of how knowledge assets are interpedently and dependently linked, and how the management of one knowledge asset activates flow dynamics, that influence both other knowledge assets and business performance. Using the KAVDM managers can reflect upon the knowledge components grounding a company's value creation and assess their mental models and views of the reality. Finally, an application of the KAVDM within a construction company is presented and its main managerial benefits addressed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This study reports on curriculum development and evaluation of a 3-day, clinically oriented patient safety intersession that was implemented at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in January 2011. Using simulation, skills demonstrations, small group exercises and case studies, this intersession focuses on improving students' teamwork and communication skills and system-based thinking while teaching on the causes of preventable harm and evidence-based strategies for harm prevention. One hundred and twenty students participated in this intersession as part of their required second year curriculum. A pre-post assessment of students' safety knowledge, self-efficacy in safety skills and system-based thinking was conducted. Student satisfaction data were also collected. Results: Students' safety knowledge scores significantly improved (mean +19% points; 95% CI 17.0 to 21.6; p<0.01). Composite system thinking scores increased from a mean pre-intersession score of 60.1 to a post-intersession score of 67.6 (p<0.01). Students had statistically significant increases in self-efficacy for all taught communication and safety skills. Participant satisfaction with the intersession was high. Conclusions: The patient safety intersession resulted in increased knowledge, system-based thinking, and selfefficacy scores among students. Similar intersessions can be implemented at medical, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health schools separately or jointly as part of required school curricula. Further study of the long-term impact of such education on knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours of students is warranted.","[Aboumatar, Hanan J.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Internal Med, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA;

Fifty students interacted with the model and manipulated a variable within it in the course of this model ecosystem yearlong inquiry, in a laboratory/traditional learning environment. Students' written responses to 10 pretest-posttest probes underwent fine-grain analysis regarding 53 descriptors of the system of feeding relations. Overall, students exhibited initial system thinking, manifested in different levels of increased ability to identify: system components, processes, levels, and their interrelations; ecosystem patterns and control mechanisms; equilibrium shifts; and spatial and temporal aspects of feeding relations. However, many still exhibited a deficient understanding of the system studied, reflecting a deficient system thinking.

OST was used to construct a model of the tobacco problem as a management system acting in a broader environment. This highlighted several problems with the current system but provided no mechanism for reform. ANT, the sociology of translation, was used for understanding how change occurs. Unlike systems thinking, ANT focuses the contest for change on heterogeneous networks of human and nonhuman actors that must be constructed through a process of defining and defending models of change, building alliances, gaining public acceptance, and finally achieving institutional acceptance of the reform (or of some compromise). We then show how this dual approach can shed light on a current challenge in controlling tobacco, the issue of product regulation, and the broader issue of harm reduction versus harm elimination.","[Coghill, Ken] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,,,,,"Akrich M, 1992, SHAPING TECHNOLOGY B, P205; Anderson P, 2006, DRUG ALCOHOL REV, V25, P489, DOI 10.1080/09595230600944446; RITTEL HWJ, 1973, POLICY SCI, V4, P155, DOI 10.1007/BF01405730; Levy DT, 2004, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V13, P2035; Gilmore AB, 2009, J PUBLIC HEALTH-UK, V31, P3, DOI 10.1093/pubmed/fdn105; Zhu SH, 2009, TOB CONTROL, V18, P82, DOI 10.1136/tc.2008.028209; DOLL R, 1954, BRIT MED J, V1, P1451; [Anonymous], 2008, BBC NEWS EUROPE 0630; Borland R, 2003, TOB CONTROL, V12, P374, DOI 10.1136/tc.12.4.374; Young D, 2010, NICOTINE TOB RES, V12, P1089, DOI 10.1093/ntr/ntq155; Young D, 2007, AUST NZ J PUBL HEAL, V31, P164, DOI 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00035.x; Hammond D, 2007, TOB CONTROL, V16, P8, DOI 10.1136/tc.2005.015297; Thrasher JF, 2009, NICOTINE TOB RES, V11, P591, DOI 10.1093/ntr/ntp039; Francey N, 2000, BRIT MED J, V321, P371, DOI 10.1136/bmj.321.7257.371; Rodu B, 2004, CRIT REV ORAL BIOL M, V15, P252; Tomar SL, 2009, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V6, P10, DOI 10.3390/ijerph6010010; Foulds J, 2003, TOB CONTROL, V12, P349, DOI 10.1136/tc.12.4.349; Arthur B., 1994, INCREASING RETURNS P; Bennis W., 1985, LEADERSUTHE STRATEGI; Benson P, 2008, AM ETHNOL, V35, P357, DOI 10.1111/j.1548-1425.2008.00040.x; Borland R, 1997, PSYCHOL HEALTH, V12, P513, DOI 10.1080/08870449708406727; Borland R, 2006, TOB CONTROL, V15, DOI 10.1136/tc.2006.017418; Boyle P., 2004, TOBACCO PUBLIC HLTH; Britton J, 2008, LANCET, V371, P441, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61482-2; Broadstock M, 2007, 101 NZ HLTH TECHN AS, V10; Callard C., 2005, CURING ADDICTION PRO; Callon M., 1986, SOCIOL REV MONOGR, V32, P196; Chapman S, 2007, PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCACY AND TOBACCO CONTROL: MAKING SMOKING HISTORY, P1, DOI 10.1002/9780470692479; Commonwealth of Australia, 2007, TACKL WICK PROBL; Craver R, 2009, WINSTONSALEM J  0518; Dachille K.

Soft systems thinking and social-learning theory expose errors in the assumption that complex systems can be dispassionately managed by objective observers and highlight the fact that conservation is a social process in which objectives are contested and learning is context dependent. We used these insights to rethink adaptive management in a way that focuses on the social processes involved in management and decision making. Our approach to adaptive management is based on the following assumptions: action toward a common goal is an emergent property of complex social relationships; the introduction of new knowledge, alternative values, and new ways of understanding the world can become a stimulating force for learning, creativity, and change; learning is contextual and is fundamentally about practice; and defining the goal to be addressed is continuous and in principle never ends. We believe five key activities are crucial to defining the goal that is to be addressed in an adaptive-management context and to determining the objectives that are desirable and feasible to the participants: situate the problem in its social and ecological context; raise awareness about alternative views of a problem and encourage enquiry and deconstruction of frames of reference; undertake collaborative actions; and reflect on learning.","[Cundill, G.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Cumming, G.

Complex or 'wicked' problems have common characteristics such as heterogeneity, nonlinearity, interdependence, and self-organization. As such they require solutions appropriate for complex problems, rather than a reductionist search for the causes. 'Systems thinking' provides new ways to consider how to collectively address complex societal problems like obesity, where biology interacts with social, cultural and built environmental factors in infinite permutations and combinations. The systems that give rise to the obesity epidemic function at multiple levels, and there are important interactions between these levels. At any given level, individual actors and organizations matter and system function is optimized when individual and organizational capacity to respond is well matched to the complexity of individual tasks. Providing system supports to help networks of individuals become 'communities of practice' and 'systems of influence' may also help to accelerate the pace of effective action against obesity. Research efforts need to move away from the relentless search for the specific isolated causes of obesity and focus on solutions that have been shown to work in addressing other 'wicked' problems. copyright (C) 2012 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

Recently, concept-mapping (CM) was suggested as an adequate instrument for analysing students' system thinking. However, there are different ways with which to use this method. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether particular features of CM practices affect the valid assessment of students' system thinking. The particular features analysed were the medium (computer versus paper-pencil) and the directedness (highly directed versus nondirected) of CM practices. These features were evaluated with respect to their influence on (a) students' performance in CM and (b) the validity of different CM practices for system thinking. One hundred fifty-four German fourth graders (mean age: 9.95 years) and 93 eighth graders (mean age: 14.07 years) participated in the study following an experimental pre-test-post-test design. Three variations of CM practices were applied: (a) highly directed computer mapping, (b) highly directed paper-pencil mapping, and (c) nondirected paper-pencil mapping. In addition to the CM task, a paper-pencil questionnaire was employed to investigate the validity of the CM practices. Results showed that the computer positively influenced student performance in CM when compared with paper-pencil. By contrast, there was no difference between highly directed and nondirected mapping. Whereas the medium rarely influenced the validity of CM for system thinking, high directedness showed a positive influence. Considering the limitations and benefits of particular CM practices, we suggest highly directed and computer-based CM as an appropriate assessment tool-in particular, with regard to large-scale assessments of system thinking.","[Brandstaedter, Kristina; Harms, Ute; Grossschedl, Joerg] Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ IPN, Dept Biol Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Harms, Ute] Linkoping Univ, ISV Dept Social & Welf Studies, Linkoping, Sweden","Brandstadter, K (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ IPN, Dept Biol Educ, Kiel, Germany.",brandstaedter@ipn.uni-kiel.de,,,,,"Anderson V., 1997, SYSTEMS THINKING BAS; Anderson-Inman L., 1993, COMPUTING TEACHER, V21, P6; Sterman JD, 2010, SYST DYNAM REV, V26, P316, DOI 10.1002/sdr.447; PAAS FGWC, 1992, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V84, P429, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429; Johnson-Laird PN, 2001, TRENDS COGN SCI, V5, P434, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01751-4; Jacobson MJ, 2006, J LEARN SCI, V15, P11, DOI 10.1207/s15327809jls1501_4; Hmelo-Silver CE, 2006, J LEARN SCI, V15, P53, DOI 10.1207/s15327809jls1501_7; Seel NM, 2001, INSTR SCI, V29, P403, DOI 10.1023/A:1011952010705; Assaraf OBZ, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P518, DOI 10.1002/tea.20061; Sterman JD, 2008, SCIENCE, V322, P532, DOI 10.1126/science.1162574; Hogan K, 2000, SCI EDUC, V84, P51, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200001)84:1<51::AID-SCE5>3.0.CO;2-H; Hu LT, 1999, STRUCT EQU MODELING, V6, P1, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; McClure JR, 1999, J RES SCI TEACH, V36, P475, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199904)36:4<475::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-O; RICHMOND B, 1993, SYST DYNAM REV, V9, P113, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260090203; Plate R, 2010, SYST DYNAM REV, V26, P19, DOI 10.1002/sdr.432; Assaraf OBZ, 2010, J RES SCI TEACH, V47, P540, DOI 10.1002/tea.20351; Boersma K, 2011, J BIOL EDUC, V45, P190, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2011.627139; Boulter C.J., 2000, DEV MODELS SCI ED, P25; Brewer W.

The paper concentrates on a systems thinking-based view to highlight the potentially endangered elements of a project, including its outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The paper gives a broad state of the art in Many scientific domains; a definition of project vulnerability; a description of a project vulnerability management process, including identification, analysis and response plan; and a test on an industrial case study. Findings - The author's project vulnerability management process permits one to concentrate directly on the existing weaknesses of a project system, which may create potential damages regarding the project values creation. By focusing on this system, response plans may be more adapted to the existing short comings of the project. Research limitations/implications - Some aspects of the vulnerability definition should be refined, like the concepts of susceptibility or cruciality. Other promising works may focus on the evaluation of the non-resistance and resilience, notably thanks to the introduction of interdependences which exist in complex projects. Practical implications - A case study was done on a decision support system (FabACT) developed at Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou Pharmacy department. The aim of this project was to achieve a better balance between the workload and the efficiency of the compounding unit.

In biology education systems thinking can be understood as thinking backward and forward between concrete biological objects and processes and systems models representing systems theoretical characteristics. Some studies claim that systems thinking can be readily introduced at the level of primary-school education; other studies claim that even in upper secondary-school education the introduction of systems thinking requires a carefully outlined approach in order not to strain students' capacities too much. In order to explain these contrasting claims a procedure of analysis was used to map and compare the conceptual frameworks of the various studies, focusing on the selection of systems, references to systems theory and definitions of systems thinking. The analysis demonstrates that the frameworks include different elements of systems thinking. In particular, the analysis shows that the studies recommending the introduction of systems thinking in primary- or lower secondary-school education did not measure students' ability to think forward and backward between concrete objects and systems models. The analysis contributes to a discussion about useful preparatory learning and teaching trajectories, preceding the formal introduction of systems thinking.","[Boersma, Kerst; Waarlo, Arend Jan; Klaassen, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Freudenthal Inst Sci & Math Educ, NL-3508 AD Utrecht, Netherlands","Boersma, K (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Freudenthal Inst Sci & Math Educ, Postbus 85170, NL-3508 AD Utrecht, Netherlands.",k.t.boersma@uu.nl,,,,,"Sweeney LB, 2000, SYST DYNAM REV, V16, P249, DOI 10.1002/sdr.198; Jacobson MJ, 2006, J LEARN SCI, V15, P11, DOI 10.1207/s15327809jls1501_4; Assaraf OBZ, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P518, DOI 10.1002/tea.20061; Ashby W.R., 1956, INTRO CYBERNETICS; Bayrhuber H, 1980, KYBERNETISCHE BIOL; Ben-Zvi Assaraf O, 2010, RES SCI EDUC, V40, P525; Evagorou M, 2009, INT J SCI EDUC, V31, P655, DOI 10.1080/09500690701749313; Hogan K, 2000, J BIOL EDUC, V35, P22, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2000.9655731; Klaassen Kees, 2008, Physics Education, V43, DOI 10.1088/0031-9120/43/4/014; Knippels M.

Current research on the transition to adulthood for disabled youth has primarily focused on identifying these multilevel factors to guide the development of interventions to improve the HCT process. However, little is known about how this complex array of factors interacts and contributes to successful HCT. Systems thinking provides a theoretically informed perspective that accounts for complexity and can contribute to enhanced understanding of the interactions among HCT factors. The objective of this paper is to introduce general concepts of systems thinking as applied to HCT practice and research. Methods Several systems thinking concepts and principles are introduced and a discussion of HCT as a complex system is provided. Systems dynamics methodology is described as one systems method for conceptualizing HCT. A preliminary systems dynamics model is presented to facilitate discourse on the application of systems thinking principles to HCT practice, policy and research. Conclusions An understanding of the complex interactions and patterns of relationships in HCT can assist health policy makers and practitioners in determining key areas of intervention, the impact of these interventions on the system and the potential intended and unintended consequences of change.

Justifications for innovation policy generally relate to notions of market failure that are applicable in all nations in all conditions. In this paper we develop a broad framework for NIS analysis, involving free market, coordination and complex-evolutionary system approaches. Within this framework we explore the evolving relationship between market failure and systems approaches to innovation policy in the case of Australia. Drawing on information and analysis collected for a major review of Australia's NIS, and the government's 10-year plan in response to it, we show how the free market trajectory of policy-making of past decades is being extended, complemented and refocused by new approaches to complex-evolutionary system thinking. These approaches are shown to emphasize the importance of systemic connectivity, evolving institutions and organizational capabilities. Nonetheless, despite the fact that there has been much progress in this direction in the Australian debate, the predominant logic behind policy choices still remains one of addressing market failure, and the primary focus of policy attention continues to be science and research rather than demand-led approaches. We discuss how the development and elaboration of notions of systems failure, rather than just market failure, can further improve policy-making in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most discussions have been highly abstract. There is a need to consider the application of complex systems approaches to specific research questions. I review the features of population health problems for which complex systems approaches are most likely to yield new insights, and discuss possible applications of complex systems to health disparities research. I provide illustrative examples of how complex systems approaches may help address unanswered and persistent questions regarding genetic factors, life course processes, place effects, and the impact of upstream policies. The concepts and methods of complex systems may help researchers move beyond current impasse points in health disparities research.

Case studies from ten selected South African and Malawian firms from largest electric power utilities, mining, petrochemical, and processing industries were used to establish causal relationships. Sample surveys of thirty four Malawian firms were used as part of a multimethod or triangulation approach to provide generalizations, validation and reliability. Of the surveyed firms, 66.7%, and of case studied firms 100%, showed that deferred refurbishment was a result of constrained capacity which led to components operating at higher loads, to lack of maintenance windows and to increased failure rates; there was no formal refurbishment model and technical skills base was the weakest asset management link. The study advances a novel way of depicting root causes of suboptimal refurbishment in typically complex dynamic structures using integrated systems thinking approach and applies analytical optimization tools, namely: Linear Programming (LP), metrics and N-1 contingency capability for refurbishment model for drilling deeper into causal typologies portrayed by systems thinking in order to solve optimization problems. A Total Refurbishment Process model is advanced to replicate refurbishment decision structures for long term sustainability of industries as validated by industries studied.","[Mkandawire, Burnet O'Brien] Univ Malawi, Fac Engn, Polytech Coll, Blantyre, Malawi; [Ijumba, Nelson Mutatina] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa; [Whitehead, Howard] Ethekwini Elect, Durban, South Africa","Mkandawire, BO (reprint author), Univ Malawi, Fac Engn, Polytech Coll, Blantyre, Malawi.",burnemkanda@hotmail.com,,,Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) of South Africa,"The authors are greatly indebted to the Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) of South Africa for funding the study, to the management of Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM), to the Eskom power utility company of South Africa and to Sasol (Secunda plant) for providing invaluable technical and professional support.","Schneider J, 2006, INT J ELEC POWER, V28, P643, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2006.03.007; Aronson Daniel, 1996, INTRO SYSTEMS THINKI; BARTLEY WH, 2002, C BREAKTH ASS MAN RE; BELSNES MM, 2002, 14 PSCC JUN 24 28 20; *BSI, 2004, 55 BSIPAS; CAMPBELL JD, 2010, UPTIME STRATEGIES EX, P10; Checkland P.B., 1990, SYSTEMS THINKING SYS; Dantzig GB, 1955, PAC J MATH, V5, P183; Davidz HL, 2008, SYSTEMS ENG, V11, P1, DOI 10.1002/sys.20081; Egbu CO, 1996, BUILD RES INF, V24, P329, DOI 10.1080/09613219608727553; ENDRENYI J, 1980, RELIABILITY MODELLIN, P251; FORRESTER J, 1961, SYSTEMS DYNAMICS; GARSON GD, 2008, CASE STUDY RES MAR 2; Hamel J., 1993, CASE STUDY METHODS; Johnson S., 1998, WHO MOVED MY CHEESE; Kelly A, 1997, MAINTENANCE STRATEGY; KEMPPAINEN M, 2002, OMMI, V1; LAWSON HB, 2010, SYSTEMS THINKING SYS; LEE C, 2006, MATCHING CLIENT PROJ; Leveson N.

The Swedish Rail Administration (SRA), a public authority responsible for Swedish rail infrastructure, was used as a case organisation. The main aim was to identify different follow-up activities during planning, construction and operation of rail infrastructure. Additional aims were to identify limiting factors for effective environmental follow-up and to provide suggestions on how SRA follow-up can better be used as an organisational learning tool. The follow-up proved to be highly influenced by Environmental Management System and was mainly used for showing compliance with legal regulations or contract requirements. Use of environmental monitoring data was limited to the specific project in which the follow-up was carried out, possibly because of the project-based structure of the organisation following rail deregulation. Theory on organisational learning was applied in the study to discuss how to improve the distribution and use of follow-up data. A more complete 'organisational memory' seems to be required for learning from experience and adapting to change.","KTH, Royal Inst Technol, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden","Lundberg, K (reprint author), KTH, Royal Inst Technol, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",krilun@kth.se,,,Swedish Rail Administration through the Centre for Research and Education in Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure (CDU),This study was financed by the Swedish Rail Administration through the Centre for Research and Education in Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure (CDU).

Many US water-bodies which have been primarily impacted by NPS pollution have not achieved water quality goals set by Clean Water Act. Technological advances have been made since 1972, yet many water resources fail to meet water quality standards. Common Pool Resources Theory is considered to understand the human dimension of NPS pollution by exploring anthropogenic activities superimposed upon dynamic ecosystems. In the final analysis, priority management zones (PMZs) for best management practice (BMP) implementation must have buy-in from land managers. TWAIM is an iterative systems thinking approach to planning, collecting landscape and land use information and communicating systems understanding to stakeholders. Hydrologic pathways that link the physical, chemical and biological characteristics influence processes occurring in a watershed which drive stream health and ecological function. With better systems understanding and application by technical specialists, there is potential for improved stakeholder interaction and dialogue which could then enable better land use decisions. Issues of pollutant origin, transport, storage and hydraulic residence must be defined and communicated effectively to land managers within a watershed context to observe trends in water quality change. The TWAIM concept provides a logical framework for locally-led assessment and a means to communicate ecohydrologic systems understanding over time to the key land managers such that PMZs can be defined for BMP implementation.","[Magner, Joe] Minnesota Pollut Control Agcy, St Paul, MN 55155 USA; [Magner, Joe] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Magner, J (reprint author), Minnesota Pollut Control Agcy, 520 Lafayette Rd, St Paul, MN 55155 USA.",magne027@umn.edu,,,,,"VANNOTE RL, 1980, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V37, P130, DOI 10.1139/f80-017; Magner JA, 2008, ENVIRON MANAGE, V42, P377, DOI 10.1007/s00267-008-9132-4; Schulz K, 2006, WATER RESOUR RES, V42, DOI 10.1029/2005WR004301; Costanza R, 1997, NATURE, V387, P253, DOI 10.1038/387253a0; MICKLIN PP, 1988, SCIENCE, V241, P1170, DOI 10.1126/science.241.4870.1170; Davenport MA, 2007, ENVIRON MANAGE, V39, P353, DOI 10.1007/s00267-006-0016-1; Paola C, 2006, WATER RESOUR RES, V42, DOI 10.1029/2005WR004336; TURNER MG, 1989, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V20, P171, DOI 10.1146/annurev.es.20.110189.001131; Thorp JH, 2006, RIVER RES APPL, V22, P123, DOI 10.1002/rra.901; Reutebuch SE, 2005, J FOREST, V103, P286; Woolcock M, 2000, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V15, P225; Meals DW, 2010, J ENVIRON QUAL, V39, P85, DOI 10.2134/jeq2009.0108; McDonnell JJ, 2007, WATER RESOUR RES, V43, DOI 10.1029/2006WR005467; Blankenship K., 2005, CHESAPEAKE BAY J DEC; Christensen V.G., 2008, EFFECTS AGR LAND RET; Dooge J.

The author illustrates the concepts drawing on the experience of five case studies already presented in the literature, all the way from service industries to highly developed technological industries. Thereafter, a list of key variables from proposed case studies are identified. Then, a causal diagram relating identified variables in some circulars is constructed and modeled. Design/methodology/approach - The paper identifies key elements of RFID through the review of six case studies. It obtains appropriate data from second sources, for some of these case studies, to make the analysis possible. Findings - To make management systems functional and successfully operational RFID solutions can be used to reduce operating costs through decreasing the labor costs, including automation, improving tracing and tracking, and preventing the lost of materials under any circumstances. RFID is an appropriate technology for profit generation, efficiency improvement, and productivity enhancement. Originality/value - The emphasis is put on delivering business values through effective variables and from there RFID can be related to profitability using systems thinking concepts. Since, to the best of this author's knowledge, this is the first paper that relates RFID technology to profitability using systems thinking concepts, it makes a significant contribution to the RFID literature.","Yazd Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Yazd, Iran","Mehrjerdi, YZ (reprint author), Yazd Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Yazd, Iran.",yazm2000@yahoo.com,,,,,"Zahay DL, 2004, IND MARKET MANAG, V33, P627, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2003.10.004; Kumar S, 2006, TECHNOVATION, V26, P739, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2005.05.006; Ngai EWT, 2008, INT J PROD ECON, V112, P630, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2007.05.011; Dutta A, 2007, PROD OPER MANAG, V16, P646; Roh JJ, 2009, INFORM MANAGE-AMSTER, V46, P357, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2009.07.001; Asif Z., 2005, COMMUNICATIONS ASS I, V15, P393; Bose I., 2005, COMMUN ACM, V48, P101; CANNON AR, 2008, INT J OPERATIONS PRO, V28; Ching SH, 2009, J ACAD LIBR, V35, P347, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2009.04.005; COOK CW, 1998, INFORM MANAGE, V34, P75; Forrester J.W., 1971, WORLD DYNAMICS; Forrester J.W., 1961, IND DYNAMICS; Forrester JW, 1985, SYST DYNAM REV, V1, P133, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260010112; KARKKAINEN M, 2003, J RETAIL DISTRIBUTIO, V31, P529; Kumar Sameer, 2009, Int J Health Care Qual Assur, V22, P67; Li S., 2006, INT J INTEGRATED SUP, V2, P407, DOI DOI 10.1504/UISM.2006.009643; Loebbecke C., 2005, 18 BLED C INT ACT, P1; Morton A.

In this article we examine the progress made so far and map the existing debates within IR that are liable to being significantly reconfigured by the conceptual resources of complexity. We consider the various ontological, epistemological and methodological questions raised by complexity theory and its attendant worldview. The article concludes that, beyond metaphor and computational models, the greatest promise of complexity is a reinvigoration of systems thinking that eschews the flaws and limitations of previous instantiations of systems theory and offers an array of conceptual tools apposite to analysing international politics in the twenty-first century.","[Bousquet, Antoine] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Curtis, Simon] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Bousquet, A (reprint author), Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,,,"Abbott A, 2001, CHAOS DISCIPLINES; ALBERT M, 2009, NEW SYSTEMS THEORIES; DESSLER D, 1989, INT ORGAN, V43, P441; Ma SY, 2007, INT POLIT SCI REV, V28, P57, DOI 10.1177/0192512107070403; Cederman LE, 2003, AM POLIT SCI REV, V97, P135; Emirbayer M, 1997, AM J SOCIOL, V103, P281, DOI 10.1086/231209; Jackson PT, 1999, EUR J INT RELAT, V5, P291, DOI 10.1177/1354066199005003002; Thompson E, 2001, TRENDS COGN SCI, V5, P418, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01750-2; Arbib M., 1986, CONSTRUCTION REALITY; Archer Margaret S, 1995, REALIST SOCIAL THEOR; Axelrod R.

Too often, we fail to learn from the past and make inadequate changes in response to losses. Examining the assumptions and paradigms underlying safety engineering may help identify the problem. The assumptions questioned in this paper involve four different areas: definitions of safety and its relationship to reliability, accident causality models, retrospective vs. prospective analysis, and operator error.

It first presents a brief description of the potential value of utilising biosphere reserves for implementing the learning laboratories concept, followed by how systemic processes have been developed to establish a Learning Laboratory through a comprehensive pilot project in the Cat Ba Biosphere Reserve (CBBR) in Vietnam. In this project Causal Loop Modelling were used to determine the components and interactions between the policy, social, environmental and economic dimensions of the CBBR. The resultant model has been used to identify key leverage points and where systemic interventions will be most effective (potential research projects). The model also serves as a platform for learning and research collaboration through alliances and cross-sectoral teams to address the various domains, leverage points, and interventions identified. The role and importance of systems thinking methodology and applications to deal with ever-increasing complexities of sustainable development are discussed. The modelling approach and various processes that were used in this pilot project could be extended to other biosphere reserves in Vietnam and globally, in that way creating a worldwide network of 'Learning Laboratories for Sustainable Development'.

One major obstacle may be that the competency alone is not sufficient to support assessment. We believe the foundational construct underlying SBP is systems thinking, absent from the current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competency language. Summary: Systems thinking is defined as the ability to analyze systems as a whole. The purpose of this article is to describe psychometric issues that constrain assessment of SBP and elucidate the role of systems thinking in teaching and assessing SBP. Conclusion: Residency programs should incorporate systems thinking models into their curricula. Trainees should be taught to understand systems at an abstract level, in order to analyze their own healthcare systems, and participate in quality and patient safety activities. We suggest that a developmental trajectory for systems thinking be developed, similar to the model described by Dreyfus and Dreyfus.","[Colbert, Colleen Y.; Ogden, Paul E.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Med, Syst Hlth Sci Ctr, Temple, TX 76508 USA; [Ownby, Allison R.] Univ Texas Houston, Med Sch Houston, Off Educ Programs, Houston, TX USA; [Bowe, Constance] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Davis Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Bowe, Constance] Partners Harvard Med Int, Boston, MA USA","Colbert, CY (reprint author), Scott & White Healthcare, 2401 S 31st St, Temple, TX 76508 USA.",cycolbert@swmail.sw.org,,,,,"Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME OUTC PROJ; Bordage G, 2009, MED EDUC, V43, P312, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03295.x; Armstrong EG, 2004, ACAD MED, V79, P721, DOI 10.1097/00001888-200408000-00002; Varkey P, 2009, ACAD MED, V84, P335, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31819731fb; Voss JD, 2008, ACAD MED, V83, P1080, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31818927f8; Lee AG, 2007, SURV OPHTHALMOL, V52, P680, DOI 10.1016/j.survophthal.2007.08.021; Bosch OJH, 2007, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V24, P217, DOI 10.1002/sres.818; Berwick DM, 1998, ANN INTERN MED, V128, P651; Ziegelstein RC, 2004, ACAD MED, V79, P83, DOI 10.1097/00001888-200401000-00018; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; Zenni EA, 2006, AMBUL PEDIATR, V6, P54, DOI 10.1016/j.ambp.2005.08.003; Berwick DM, 2008, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V299, P1182, DOI 10.1001/jama.299.10.1182; Mintzberg H, 1999, HARVARD BUS REV, V77, P87; Bagian JP, 2006, PEDIATR RADIOL, V36, P287, DOI 10.1007/s00247-006-0119-0; Englander R, 2006, TEACH LEARN MED, V18, P150, DOI 10.1207/s15328015tlm1802_10; Turley CB, 2007, TEACH LEARN MED, V19, P128; [Anonymous], 1999, STAND ED PSYCH TEST; Werhane PH, 2002, J BUS ETHICS, V38, P33, DOI 10.1023/A:1015737431300; ARMSTRONG EG, 2009, HARVARD MACY I COURS; ARONSON D, 2008, INTRO ST INTRO SYSTE; Batalden Paul B, 2009, J Grad Med Educ, V1, P1, DOI 10.4300/01.01.0001; Chen DT, 2008, ACAD MED, V83, P723, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31817ec0d3; Colbert CY, 2009, ACAD MED, V84, P1833, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf27db; Cruff P.

We use two contrasting case studies, coral reef management in the Philippines and national park management in Australia, to illustrate the value of critical systems approaches in exploring how people respond to environmental threats to their physical and spiritual well-being. In both cases, we used visual methods-participatory modeling and rich picturing, respectively. The critical systems methodology, with its emphasis on reflection, guided an appraisal of the research process. A discussion of these two case studies suggests that visual methods can be usefully applied within a critical systems framework to offer new insights into ecohealth issues across a diverse range of socio-political contexts. With this article, we hope to open up a conversation with other practitioners to expand the use of visual methods in integrated research.","[Cleland, Deborah; Wyborn, Carina] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Wyborn, C (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",carina.wyborn@anu.edu.au,,,,,"Brosius JP, 1998, SOC NATUR RESOUR, V11, P157, DOI 10.1080/08941929809381069; Ulrich W, 2003, J OPER RES SOC, V54, P325, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601518; Brooke C, 2002, J INFORM TECHNOL, V17, P49, DOI 10.1080/02683960210164336; Camargo C, 2009, BIODIVERS CONSERV, V18, P935, DOI 10.1007/s10531-008-9555-5; Packard J, 2008, VISUAL STUD, V23, P63, DOI 10.1080/14725860801908544; Guillemin M, 2004, QUAL HEALTH RES, V14, P272, DOI 10.1177/1049732303260445; Leach M, 1999, WORLD DEV, V27, P225, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00141-7; Wyborn C, 2009, AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN, V16, P208; Kellert SR, 2000, SOC NATUR RESOUR, V13, P705, DOI 10.1080/089419200750035575; Checkland P, 2000, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V17, pS11, DOI 10.1002/1099-1743(200011)17:1+<::AID-SRES374>3.0.CO;2-O; Checkland P.

Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of ""concept viewing"" tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct ""stories,"" each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

The Complex Network Electronic Knowledge Translation Research model (CoNEKTR) brings together complexity science, design thinking, social learning theories, systems thinking and eHealth technologies together to support a sustained engagement strategy for social innovation support and enhancing knowledge integration. Methods The CoNEKTR model adapts elements of other face-to-face social organizing methods and combines it with social media and electronic networking tools to create a strategy for idea generation, refinement and social action. Drawing on complexity science, a series of networking and dialogue-enhancing activities are employed to bring diverse groups together, facilitate dialogue and create networks of networks. Results Ten steps and five core processes informed by complexity science have been developed through this model. Concepts such as emergence, attractors and feedback play an important role in facilitating networking among participants in the model. Conclusions Using a constrained, focused approach informed by complexity science and using information technology, the CoNEKTR model holds promise as a means to enhance system capacity for knowledge generation, learning and action while working within the limitations faced by busy health professionals.","[Norman, Cameron D.; Charnaw-Burger, Jill; Yip, Andrea L.; Saad, Sam; Lombardo, Charlotte] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Youth Voices Res Grp, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada","Norman, CD (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Youth Voices Res Grp, 155 Coll St,Room 586, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7, Canada.",cameron.norman@utoronto.ca,,,,,"AMBROSE G, 2010, BASICS DESIGN DESIGN; Sterman JD, 2002, SYST DYNAM REV, V18, P501, DOI 10.1002/sdr.261; Christakis NA, 2008, NEW ENGL J MED, V358, P2249, DOI 10.1056/NEJMsa0706154; Israel BA, 1998, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V19, P173, DOI 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.19.1.173; Hirsch GB, 2007, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V39, P239, DOI 10.1007/s10464-007-9114-3; Davis D, 2003, BRIT MED J, V327, P33, DOI 10.1136/bmj.327.7405.33; Pearson M, 2000, DRUG-EDUC PREV POLIC, V7, P21, DOI 10.1080/713660095; Deci EL, 2008, CAN PSYCHOL, V49, P182, DOI 10.1037/a0012801; Green LW, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P406, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.066035; Graham ID, 2006, J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH, V26, P13, DOI 10.1002/chp.47; Ryan RM, 2000, AM PSYCHOL, V55, P68, DOI 10.1037//0003-066X.55.1.68; Christakis NA, 2007, NEW ENGL J MED, V357, P370, DOI 10.1056/NEJMsa066082; Wenger EC, 2000, HARVARD BUS REV, V78, P139; Prince M, 2004, J ENG EDUC, V93, P223; Barab SA, 2002, J LEARN SCI, V11, P489, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS1104_3; Homer JB, 2006, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V96, P452, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2005.062059; Best A, 2008, PATIENT EDUC COUNS, V71, P319, DOI 10.1016/j.pec.2008.02.013; PATTON MQ, 1994, EVAL PRACT, V15, P311; Green LW, 2006, EVAL HEALTH PROF, V29, P126, DOI 10.1177/0163278705284445; Suitor J, 1997, SOC NETWORKS, V19, P51, DOI 10.1016/S0378-8733(96)00290-0; Kitson AL, 2009, J ADV NURS, V65, P217, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04864.x; Castleden H, 2008, SOC SCI MED, V66, P1393, DOI [10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.11.030, 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.11.031]; ARAL S, 2009, WORKSH INF NETW WIN; Argyris C., 1985, ACTION SCI CONCEPTS; Balas E.

There are two main lines of thought in systems thinking that lead to wholly different conceptions about action research. The first (systems thinking) advocates thinking about real social systems that it assumes exist in the world. The second (systemic thinking) supposes only that the social construction of the world is systemic. Greater emphasis is placed on systemic thinking consistent with its greater importance to contemporary action research. The article concludes that systemic thinking when taken to its practical conclusion from a critical perspective offers to action research a somewhat unique liberating praxis. Concern that any liberating praxis could remain hollow is addressed through a certain kind of 'spiritual' awareness that is suggested by wholeness.,"Maastricht Sch Management, NL-6229 EP Maastricht, Netherlands","Flood, RL (reprint author), Maastricht Sch Management, Endepolsdomein 150, NL-6229 EP Maastricht, Netherlands.",flood@msm.nl,,,,,"Ackoff R L, 1974, REDESIGNING FUTURE; Ackoff R.

This analysis suggests that career counselors need to infuse systems approaches into professional practice, for example, use of systems language that assists the client in exploring career plans. The authors also identified various new right-brain directed thinking approaches (Pink, 2006; Shutt, 2008) for use in career counseling sessions.

It addresses the question of whether elementary school students can deal with complex systems. The sample included 40 4th grade students from one school in a small town in Israel. The students studied an inquiry-based earth systems curriculum that focuses on the hydro-cycle. The program involved lab simulations and experiments, direct interaction with components and processes of the water cycle in the outdoor learning environment and knowledge integration activities. Despite the students' minimal initial system thinking abilities, most of them made significant progress with their ability to analyze the hydrological earth system to its components and processes. As a result, they recognized interconnections between components of a system. Some of the students reached higher system thinking abilities, such as identifying interrelationships among several earth systems and identifying hidden parts of the hydrological system. The direct contact with real phenomena and processes in small scale scenarios enabled these students to create a concrete local water cycle, which could later be expanded into large scale abstract global cycles. The incorporation of outdoor inquiry-based learning with lab inquiry-based activities and knowledge integration assignments contributed to the 4th grade students' capacity to develop basic system thinking abilities at their young age. This suggests that although system thinking is regarded as a high order thinking skill, it can be developed to a certain extent in elementary school. With a proper long-term curriculum, these abilities can serve as the basis for the development of higher stages of system thinking at the junior high/middle school level.

These investigations are often assisted by causal analysis tools that help to ensure that the investigation and the information captured are systematic. However, current causal analysis tools are not designed to analyse dynamic complexity of major incidents and safety culture, which arises from the interactions between actors and the temporal and spatial gaps between actions and consequences. This is because most causal analysis tools model events and causal factors linearly. In contrast, systems thinking, a discipline of seeing systems holistically, emphasises the circular nature of complex systems, i.e. cause and effect are not distinguishable. This paper proposes that traditional causal analysis tools and investigation should be enhanced with the use of systems thinking tools. One of the systems thinking tools that is particularly useful in analysing major incidents and safety culture is causal loop diagrams. The diagrams can be used to explain the systemic structure sustaining a safety culture and identify effective interventions to improve the safety culture and prevent a recurrence of a major incident. The paper demonstrates the use of systems thinking and causal loop diagrams through a case study on Bellevue hazardous waste fire in Western Australia. The case study shows how different actors in the system, each acting in reaction to pressures that they are facing, produced and sustained a poor safety culture that was a major contributory factor to the fire in 2001.

As family therapists take part in these efforts, they bring with them a worldview that adds valuable contributions to the nature in which fieldwork is conducted and the manners in which interdisciplinary teams function on the ground. In this article, we present how systems thinking sensitizes trauma workers to a variety of clinical presentations and biopsychosocial complexities inherent in this work. We describe common clinical-and practice-related challenges, alongside practical strategies for effectively dealing with these challenges. We draw upon our experiences as family therapists trained in the field of trauma, and our work as field responders, supervisors and team leaders across a variety of local and large-scale disaster events and contexts.","[Mendenhall, Tai J.; Berge, Jerica M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA","Mendenhall, TJ (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.",mend0009@umn.edu,,,,,"*AM RED CROSS, 2008, DIS SERV TRAIN; Lum W, 2002, CONTEMP FAM THER, V24, P181, DOI 10.1023/A:1014385908625; Walsh F, 2007, FAM PROCESS, V46, P207, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2007.00205.x; Sabin-Farrell R, 2003, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V23, P449, DOI 10.1016/S0272-7358(03)00030-8; Flaskas C, 2007, J FAM THER, V29, P186, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00381.x; Timm TM, 1999, CONTEMP FAM THER, V21, P331, DOI 10.1023/A:1021960315503; Woodcock J, 2001, J FAM THER, V23, P136, DOI 10.1111/1467-6427.00174; ENGEL GL, 1977, SCIENCE, V196, P129, DOI 10.1126/science.847460; BACIGALUPE G, 2002, J SYSTEMIC THERAPIES, V1, P11; Blackwell D, 1997, J SOC WORK PRACT, V11, P81, DOI 10.1080/02650539708415116; BLOUNT A, 2002, ADV MED PSYCHOTHERAP, V11, P199; Blow AJ, 2001, J MARITAL FAM THER, V27, P385, DOI 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2001.tb00333.x; Boss P, 2003, J MARITAL FAM THER, V29, P455; Boss P., 2002, LANCET, V360, P39; Boss P., 2006, LOSS TRAUMA RESILIEN; Boss P, 1999, AMBIGUOUS LOSS LEARN; Boss PG, 2002, FAM PROCESS, V41, P14, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.40102000014.x; BREMMER D, 2002, DOES STRESS DAMAGE B; Catherall DR, 2002, FAM PROCESS, V41, P18, DOI 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.40102000018.x; de Zulueta F, 2006, J FAM THER, V28, P334, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6427.2006.00356.x; Doherty WJ, 1987, FAMILY MED MATURING, P51; EVERLY GS, 2003, CRITICAL INCIDENT ST; Figley C.

When they first worked together in the 1980s, events such as the Chernobyl and Challenger accidents highlighted the fact that in seeking the causes of many modern large-scale accidents we must now consider the interaction between technology and organisational failings. Theoretical models also moved on at that time from descriptions of accidents and their causes, in an attempt to specify 'safe' cultures and 'high-reliability' organisations. Recent research has shown us that while effective learning about hazards is a common assumption of such attempts, organisations can still be very resistant to learn the full lessons from past incidents and mistakes. This paper discusses the ways of addressing barriers to learning in high-risk socio-technical systems.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales","Pidgeon, N (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",Pidgeonn@cardiff.ac.uk,"Pidgeon, Nicholas/G-2375-2010",,,,"Pidgeon N, 1998, WORK STRESS, V12, P202, DOI 10.1080/02678379808256862; Pidgeon N, 2000, SAFETY SCI, V34, P15, DOI 10.1016/S0925-7535(00)00004-7; Guldenmund FW, 2000, SAFETY SCI, V34, P215, DOI 10.1016/S0925-7535(00)00014-X; Cox S, 1998, WORK STRESS, V12, P189, DOI 10.1080/02678379808256861; Beck U, 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI; Blockley D.

The main focus of the paper lies on the effectiveness of different teaching methods in promoting systems thinking in the field of Education for Sustainable Development. The following methods were incorporated into the study: special lessons designed to promote systems thinking, a computer-simulated scenario on the topic ""ecosystem forest,"" and a combination of both special lessons and the computer simulation. These groups were then compared to a control group. A questionnaire was used to assess systems thinking skills of 424 sixth-grade students of secondary schools in Germany. The assessment differentiated between a conceptual understanding (measured as achievement score) and a reflexive justification (measured as justification score) of systems thinking. The following control variables were used: logical thinking, grades in school, memory span, and motivational goal orientation. Based on the pretest-posttest control group design, only those students who received both special instruction and worked with the computer simulation showed a significant increase in their achievement scores. The justification score increased in the computer simulation condition as well as in the combination of computer simulation and lesson condition. The possibilities and limits of promoting various forms of systems thinking by using realistic computer simulations are discussed.","[Riess, Werner; Mischo, Christoph] Univ Educ Freiburg, Dept Biol, PH Freiburg, D-79117 Freiburg, Germany","Riess, W (reprint author), Univ Educ Freiburg, Dept Biol, PH Freiburg, D-79117 Freiburg, Germany.",riess@ph-freiburg.de,,,,,"Sweeney LB, 2000, SYST DYNAM REV, V16, P249, DOI 10.1002/sdr.198; SEGER CA, 1994, PSYCHOL BULL, V115, P163, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.115.2.163; Assaraf OBZ, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P518, DOI 10.1002/tea.20061; Zohar A, 2003, J LEARN SCI, V12, P145, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_1; Kali Y, 2003, J RES SCI TEACH, V40, P545, DOI 10.1002/tea.10096; Vollmeyer R, 2002, EXP PSYCHOL, V49, P98, DOI 10.1027//1618-3169.49.2.98; BOLSCHO D, 1996, UMWELTBILDUNG OKOLOG; Bonate PL, 2000, ANAL PRETEST POSTTES; BOSSEL H, 1976, OVERLAPPING TENDENCI, P1; Bossel H., 2004, SYSTEME DYNAMIK SIMU; Campbell N.

The nature of the contract changes the dynamics of the delivery, bringing complex issues such as customer behaviours and involvement to the forefront, with both customer and firm focused on value co-creation and co-production, rather than each party's contractual obligation. We uncover four areas that are crucial in the understanding of value co-production in service delivery and analysed them through a systems approach combined with the application of the service-dominant logic, both considered as the theoretical underpinnings of service science.

In this paper practical ways to reduce the deficit are proposed that ought to increase the responsiveness of Foresight programmes to society's values, concerns and expectations. The existence of the deficit is examined placing ever more emphasis on the need for the active participation by a balanced but wide spread of stakeholders who will help to shape the future of society through the practical scheme proposed. The notions of 'situations' and Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) are combined into a metaphor to suggest how the deficit in Foresight might be reduced. The purpose is to ensure, as far as that is possible, that the process of participation is genuine, inclusive and effective: practical steps toward this are suggested. The subjective nature of the metaphors assists the interpretation of these suggestions. The notion of 'situations' and Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) represents an attempt to provide a metaphorical foundation for inclusive Foresight. At their core, 'situations' and CSH consider that problem definitions, proposals for improvement, and evaluations of outcomes depend on prior judgements about the relevant system. The resulting framework that emerges from CSH is a set of boundary concepts usable as a checklist of critical boundary questions. The checklist may be grouped under four issues relating to sources cif: (i) motivation, (ii) power, (iii) knowledge, and (iv) legitimization. The current paper discusses the application of the 'situation' cum CSH metaphor for the case of nano-science. nano-technology and nano-artifacts that are being widely adopted in areas such as materials, ICTs, and medicine. As a result of the growing interest for nano-field, nano-artifacts are now reaching the consumer markets within a large number of branches. On the other hand there is a growing scepticism about the nano-field regarding the environmental and health risks of nano-artifacts along with the ethical and legal issues arising as a result of the widespread use of these products. A number of processes have been designed and implemented concerning the legal, ethical and social impacts of nano-sciences, -technologies, and -artifacts. The paper suggests that inclusive Foresight, reinforced with the principles of CSH, can be of use in the nano-field providing wider stakeholder representation during the research and development processes. Such processes will contribute to the development of more socially and environmentally responsive nano-artifacts.

While useful in describing some programs, the linear nature of the logic model makes it difficult to capture the complex relationships within larger, multifaceted programs. Causal loop diagrams based on a systems thinking approach can better capture a multidimensional, layered program model while providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between program elements, which enables evaluators to examine influences and dependencies between and within program components. Few studies describe how to conceptualize and apply systems models for educational program evaluation. The goal of this paper is to use our NSF-funded, Interdisciplinary GK-12 project: Bringing Authentic Problem Solving in STEM to Rural Middle Schools to illustrate a systems thinking approach to model a complex educational program to aid in evaluation. GK-12 pairs eight teachers with eight STEM doctoral fellows per program year to implement curricula in middle schools. We demonstrate how systems thinking provides added value by modeling the participant groups, instruments, outcomes, and other factors in ways that enhance the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations of the model include added complexity. Implications include better understanding of interactions and outcomes and analyses reflecting interacting or conflicting variables.

However, this idea is rapidly changing due to reasons discussed in this study. Many U.S. nuclear power plants are receiving life extensions decades beyond their originally planned lives, which requires the consideration of new risks and uncertainties. This research first investigates those potential risks and sheds light on how nuclear utilities perceive and plan for these risks. After that, it examines the need for systems thinking for extended operation of nuclear reactors in the U.S. Finally, it concludes that U.S. nuclear power plants are good examples of systems in need of change from a traditional managerial view to a systems approach.","[Sireli, A.

In seeking to fulfil this purpose, it employs Boulding's well-known 'hierarchy of complexity' to think through the reasons for the emergence of different strands of applied systems thinking and to detail their strengths. In theoretical terms, operational researchers will find a number of the key issues that have engaged their field (eg, hard versus soft approaches) mirrored in debates that have taken place between systems thinkers. They may discover new theoretical avenues to follow to advance their discipline. OR practitioners may also be surprised by the nature and scope of the systems applications described and conclude that systems approaches should be added to their own intervention strategies. At the least, the paper is designed to reinvigorate discussion around the relationship between OR and systems thinking that has occasionally surfaced over the last half century but has never been satisfactorily concluded.","Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England","Jackson, MC (reprint author), Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",M.C.Jackson@hull.ac.uk,"Kumar, Ajit/J-1617-2015","Kumar, Ajit/0000-0003-3255-5054",,,"Ackoff R.

At the level of practice, there is some evidence, if still patchy, that established systemic methodologies (SM) developed in the UK have been informing KM practice. This paper discusses the conceptual links between ST and KM, exploring the theoretical approaches that were embedded in the early KM literature. A survey of journals from both systems practice and KM areas is carried out to assess the exposure of SM in KM articles. Titles and abstracts of papers published in a sample of management science (MS)/operational research (OR) and KM journals between 1995 and 2005 were queried for the occurrence of SM typical keywords in order to identify articles that have used ST in general and a SM in particular. Results suggest that methods such as systems dynamics, complexity theory, soft systems methodology, viable systems model and critical systems have started to become visible in KM applications; we discuss some of these articles focusing on the methodological orientations of the approaches used. The paper aims to raise KM and systemic practice researchers' awareness of the benefits of further exchange and conversation between these two fields of management.

Inevitably, this brings with it changes in the way that products should be thought about and designed. The purpose of this paper is to try and help product designers and Ergonomists to get a grip on all the complexity and non-linearity that the information age brings with it, and help make themselves and their increasingly networked and interoperable products at home in it.

In responding to Scott's concerns, I argue that addressing challenges related to development and the environment requires examining EE goals at multiple levels as well as bridging diverse disciplines. I further suggest that integrating social-ecological systems and other approaches in environmental education research may provide a means for consilience among potentially divisive environmental education practice and research traditions. In so doing, I hope to spark debate about possibilities for an environmental education research agenda and learning organisation that spurs action relevant to concerns about the environment, individuals, and their communities.","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Initiat Civ Ecol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Krasny, ME (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Initiat Civ Ecol, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mek2@coebwll.edu,,,,,"Chawla L, 2002, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V22, P201, DOI 10.1006/jevp.2002.0244; Kuo FE, 2001, ENVIRON BEHAV, V33, P343, DOI 10.1177/00139160121973025; Olsson P, 2004, ENVIRON MANAGE, V34, P75, DOI 10.1007/s00267-003-0101-7; Kuo FE, 1998, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V26, P823, DOI 10.1023/A:1022294028903; [Anonymous], 1997, ENVIRON EDUC RES, DOI DOI 10.1080/1350462970030205; Barab S., 2006, ED RES, V35, P3, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X035005003; Bowers C., 2002, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V8, P21, DOI 10.1080/13504620120109628; Boyer L, 2006, SCI EDUC, V90, P1028, DOI 10.1002/sce.20162; Chawla L, 2007, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V13, P437, DOI DOI 10.1080/13504620701581539; DUFFIN M, 2007, N AM ASS ENV ED RES; Folke C., 2002, RESILIENCE SUSTAINAB; *FOR FUT, 2008, 5 CAP MOD; Friere P., 1970, PEDAGOGY OPPRESSED; Gough N., 1999, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V5, P407, DOI DOI 10.1080/1350462990050406; Gough S., 2006, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V12, P335, DOI 10.1080/13504620600799083; Gruenewald D., 2003, ED RES, V32, P3, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X032004003; Gruenewald D.

The learning environment included interactive simulations using the Stagecast Creator software to simulate the ecosystem of a marsh. Simulations are an important tool in any effort to develop system thinking, because they have the potential to highlight the dynamic nature of systems. Before the implementation of the learning environment (over a period of five 90-min lessons) two written tests were administered to the students, investigating the development of seven aspects of system thinking. The same tests were administered after the implementation. Specifically, four of the tasks included in each test were associated with skills concerning the structure and the elements of a system and three were associated with the processes and interactions taking place within a system. The findings indicated that elementary school students have the potential to develop system thinking skills. The proposed learning environment provoked considerable improvements in some system thinking skills during a relatively brief learning process. However, the learning environment was not successful in promoting feedback thinking. We interpret these results in view of the difficulties encountered by the students. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of learning environments.","[Evagorou, Maria] Kings Coll London, Dept Educ & Profess Studies, London SE1 9NH, England; [Korfiatis, Kostas; Nicolaou, Christiana; Constantinou, Costas] Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus","Evagorou, M (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Dept Educ & Profess Studies, Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins Bldg,Waterl, London SE1 9NH, England.",maria.evagorou@kcl.ac.uk,,"Nicolaou, Christiana/0000-0002-8844-6108",,,"Aikenhead G.

In 2003 it adopted a form of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for its plans and programs (referred to here as PEIA) with the aim of moving towards greater environmental sustainability. The literature has explored primarily the issue of methods and legal procedures. This research contributes to the analysis of PEIA through a different set of interpretative lens. Drawing on recent developments in the theory and practice of SEA, I propose a conceptualization of SEA effectiveness that combines direct and incremental impacts, and a need for context-specific systems as a way to focus on the relationship between assessment, planning, and their context, and thus maximize effectiveness. This framework underpins the analysis of China's experience, which I explore with the help of interview material and the literature. The result is an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of PEIA in terms of its purpose, assessment concept, process, and methods. The detailed analysis of six aspects of the context helps explain the origin of such shortcomings, and identify opportunities for its improvement. I conclude defining elements of a context-specific system for SEA that seeks to maximize the opportunity for incremental, as well as direct, effectiveness in China.","[Bina, Olivia] Alameda Univ, Univ Lisbon, Fac Letras, Ctr Filosofia, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bina, Olivia] Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Urban & Reg Syst, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bina, Olivia] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Bina, O (reprint author), Alameda Univ, Univ Lisbon, Fac Letras, Ctr Filosofia, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal.",o.c.bina.92@cantab.net,,"Bina, Olivia/0000-0001-9183-7508",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; Chinese University of Hong Kong for Visiting Scholar,"I gratefully acknowledge the support of the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and the Chinese University of Hong Kong for Visiting Scholar status in 2007.

The paper lays a foundation for the conceptual understanding of systems thinking and transdisciplinary research, and will provide illustrative examples within and beyond public health.

However, there is disagreement about what constitutes systems thinking. Its meaning is ambiguous, and systems scholars have made diverse and divergent attempts to describe it. Alternative origins include: von Bertalanffy, Aristotle, Lao Tsu or multiple aperiodic ""waves."" Some scholars describe it as synonymous with systems sciences (i.e., nonlinear dynamics, complexity, chaos). Others view it as taxonomy-a laundry list of systems approaches. Within so much noise, it is often difficult for evaluators to find the systems thinking signal. Recent work in systems thinking describes it as an emergent property of four simple conceptual patterns (rules). For an evaluator to become a ""systems thinker"", lie or she need not spend years learning many methods or nonlinear sciences. Instead, with some practice, one can learn to apply these four simple rules to existing evaluation knowledge with transformative results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the literature to date has not yet developed a pragmatic, descriptive summary of firms' designs for CSR adoption, along with a practical menu of ways to implement their designs in organizational systems. To address these gaps, this paper aims to make three principle contributions. First, it defines CSR, sustainability and their relationship in practical terms. Second, it develops a typology of CSR standpoints that incorporates a number of other classifications. Third, it offers a menu of practical methods and measurement metrics based on interpretive and complex adaptive systems perspectives. The result is a hands-on guide to the process of achieving sustainability goals and objectives from a variety of ideological positions and systems designs, thereby contributing to both managerial practice and sustainability theory.

The aim is to develop a values-based model for corporate governance in this age of globalization that will be appropriate in a variety of challenging cultural and economic settings. I shall present an analysis of mental models from a social constructivist perspective. I shall then develop the notion of moral imagination as one way to revisit traditional mind-sets about values-based corporate governance and outline what I mean by systems thinking.

Thus, there is increasing interest in educating and training engineering professionals to think more systemically. in particular, there is an increasing need to accelerate the development of senior systems engineers. As new educational degree programs in systems rapidly emerge and as companies scurry to establish systems training programs to meet this need, fundamental questions still remain about how systems thinking develops in engineers. Increased understanding of the mechanisms that develop systems thinking will enable effective and efficient development of senior systems professionals. After reviewing related literature, an exploratory and inductive study was designed to gather data on enablers, barriers, and precursors to systems thinking development in engineers. In a field study conducted primarily in the United States aerospace sector, 205 interviews were conducted in 10 host companies. Senior systems engineers were studied to better understand how they developed systems thinking, and information was collected on company procedures for developing systems engineers. Using interview and survey data, comparisons were made of two control groups and senior systems engineers. Proven stellar systems thinkers were also interviewed. To summarize the results, even though systems thinking definitions diverge, there is consensus on primary mechanisms that enable or obstruct systems thinking development in engineers. In order to reconcile the divergent definitions observed, a systems thinking framework and definition are given. The data show that the primary mechanisms that enable systems thinking development include experiential learning, specific individual characteristics, and a supporting environment. This document defines the research space on this topic and suggests applications for the results, Better understanding of systems thinking development provides a foundation for educational interventions and employee development in systems thinking for engineering professionals across industry, government, and academia.

A pilot programme was developed in which three housing organizations used the approach in different service areas. The results indicate that LS can yield efficiency gains and improvements in service performance, customer satisfaction and staff morale-although securing and sustaining these results requires considerable organizational commitment. The LS approach is outlined, work in the pilots described and the results presented. A theoretical analysis seeks to locate LS in the spectrum of systems methodologies and to delimit its particular area of competence.","[Jackson, M.

Although there are clearly practical difficulties in addressing and responding to the heterogeneous requirements expressed by different users, marginalizing these views ultimately is to the detriment of the systems built. This paper describes the development of an electronic clinical handover system at the Department of General Internal Medicine (DGIM), Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH). More specifically, the paper aims to highlight how to engage meaningfully with clinicians in the development of a sustainable system. It is anticipated that by drawing attention to the importance of users and by outlining the practical experience of dealing with the diversity of requirements and views expressed, the paper can contribute to a stronger recognition within the domain of eHealth for a user-centred systems approach to IT development.","[Wong, Ming Chao; Turner, Paul; Yee, Kwang Chien] Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat Syst, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Wong, MC (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat Syst, Private Bag 87, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",mcwong@utas.edu.au,,"Turner, Paul/0000-0003-4504-2338",,,"Littlejohns P, 2003, BRIT MED J, V326, P860, DOI 10.1136/bmj.326.7394.860; Wears RL, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V293, P1261, DOI 10.1001/jama.293.10.1261; Koppel R, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V293, P1197, DOI 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197; BERG M, 2004, HLTH INFORM MANAGEME; BERNAU S, 2006, STUDENTBMJ, V14, P188; BOdker Kjeld, 2004, PARTICIPATORY IT DES; Cheah LP, 2005, MED J AUSTRALIA, V183, P369; Neuman WL, 1997, SOCIAL RES METHODS Q; Norman D.A., 2004, WHY WE LOVE HATE EVE; VALACICH JS, 2004, ESSENTIALS SYSTEMS A; Wong MC, 2007, ST HEAL T, V130, P279",11,9,9,2,5,I O S PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,,978-1-58603-864-9,ST HEAL T,,,2008,136,,,,,,490,495,,,,6,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,BNF16,WOS:000274308700081,18487779J,"Yoon, SA",,,,"Yoon, Susan A.",,,An evolutionary approach to harnessing complex systems thinking in the science and technology classroom,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COGNITION; STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION,"Educational efforts to incorporate ethical decision-making in science classrooms about current science and technology issues have met with great challenges. Some research suggests that the inherent complexity in both the subject matter content and the structure and dynamics of classrooms contribute to this challenge. This study seeks to investigate the viability of an educational heuristic based on a complex systems evolutionary approach to both harness complexity inherent in the learning system of the classroom and to improve student knowledge of a complex scientific issue. The evolutionary mechanisms of variation, interaction, and selection were used to construct a 10-day curriculum and instruction unit on the topic of genetic engineering. Eleven Grade 9 students participated in the study. The data analysis was completed using three data sources: daily database discussions and ratings and rationales provided over four time-points, probing student opinions and understanding of genetic engineering research. A repeated-measures analysis of variance conducted on 43 student rationales indicated a continuing trend of increasing understanding of complex systems concepts over time. There is also evidence to show that students as a whole group operated as a complex system in their patterns of decision-making. A number of themes identified in student database discussions reveal processes students themselves believed influenced change at the social and conceptual level, including the evolutionary mechanisms upon which the program was designed.","Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Yoon, SA (reprint author), Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, 3700 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",yoonsa@gse.upenn.edu,,,,,"ABRAHAM C, 2001, GLOBE MAIL       AUG, V8, pA1; American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1993, BENCHM SCI LIT; Andrew J, 2001, SCI EDUC, V85, P769, DOI 10.1002/sce.1038; Andrews G, 2003, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V19, P209, DOI 10.1046/j.0266-4909.2003.00021.x; Resnick M, 1998, J LEARN SCI, V7, P153, DOI 10.1207/s15327809jls0702_1; Jacobson MJ, 2006, J LEARN SCI, V15, P11, DOI 10.1207/s15327809jls1501_4; Osborne J, 2001, INT J SCI EDUC, V23, P441, DOI 10.1080/09500690010006518; Hogan K, 1999, SCI EDUC, V83, P1; FLAVELL JH, 1979, AM PSYCHOL, V34, P906, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906; Wilensky U, 2006, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V24, P171, DOI 10.1207/s1532690xci2402_1; MASON L, 1994, INSTR SCI, V22, P157, DOI 10.1007/BF00892241; Baxter GP, 1996, EDUC PSYCHOL, V31, P133, DOI 10.1207/s15326985ep3102_5; Driver R, 2000, SCI EDUC, V84, P287, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200005)84:3<287::AID-SCE1>3.0.CO;2-A; Colella V, 2000, J LEARN SCI, V9, P471, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0904_4; Schraw G, 1998, INSTR SCI, V26, P113, DOI 10.1023/A:1003044231033; Hurd PD, 1998, SCI EDUC, V82, P407, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3<407::AID-SCE6>3.3.CO;2-Q; Axelrod R.

This claim implies that there is (i) an enduring something, (ii) it is native, and (iii) it is under threat from invasive species. I examine these implications in turn, first considering the role of the observer in invasion biology, particularly in preferring a nature characterized by stability rather than flux. Second, I examine the concept of ""native"" given that humans are thoroughly embedded within ecological systems. Third, I demonstrate how our exclusion of humans conditions us to consider invasive species a primary threat rather than one among many interacting causal agents of global change; in particular, recent evidence indicates that these agents, which include human-caused disturbances and global warming (not to mention human population growth and global trade), may overwhelm the effects of invasive species per se. For these and other reasons, some ecologists have argued that ecological change is inevitable and that our concerns about invasive species are unjustified. I discuss these issues and suggest ways for ecologists to conduct engaged research through appropriate advocacy and engagement with stakeholders dealing with local invasive species.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Environm & Resource Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Larson, BMH (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Environm & Resource Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",,,,,,"Manchester SJ, 2000, J APPL ECOL, V37, P845, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00538.x; Stohlgren TJ, 2006, RISK ANAL, V26, P163, DOI 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00707.x; Lodge DM, 2003, CONSERV BIOL, V17, P31, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.02366.x; Sagoff M, 2005, J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC, V18, P215, DOI 10.1007/s10806-005-1500-y; Lackey RT, 2007, CONSERV BIOL, V21, P12, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00639.x; Hulme PE, 2006, J APPL ECOL, V43, P43, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01102.x; Chew MK, 2003, SCIENCE, V301, P52, DOI 10.1126/science.1085274; Dukes JS, 1999, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V14, P135, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(98)01554-7; Maheu-Giroux M, 2007, LANDSCAPE ECOL, V22, P285, DOI 10.1007/s10980-006-9024-z; Thomsen MA, 2006, PLANT ECOL, V186, P23, DOI 10.1007/s11258-006-9109-4; Farnsworth EJ, 2004, RHODORA, V106, P97; Hooper DU, 2005, ECOL MONOGR, V75, P3, DOI 10.1890/04-0922; Keller RP, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P203, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0605787104; Mack RN, 2000, ECOL APPL, V10, P689, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0689:BICEGC]2.0.CO;2; Lodge DM, 2006, ECOL APPL, V16, P2035, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2035:BIRFUP]2.0.CO;2; Willis KJ, 2006, SCIENCE, V314, P1261, DOI 10.1126/science.1122667; Weber JR, 2001, BIOSCIENCE, V51, P487, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0487:TCPAEC]2.0.CO;2; Gurevitch J, 2004, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V19, P470, DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.005; Lach D, 2003, BIOSCIENCE, V53, P170, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0170:AACOES]2.0.CO;2; Callicott JB, 1999, CONSERV BIOL, V13, P22, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.97333.x; Fridley JD, 2007, ECOLOGY, V88, P3, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[3:TIPRPA]2.0.CO;2; Muirhead JR, 2006, DIVERS DISTRIB, V12, P71, DOI 10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00218.x; Von der Lippe M, 2007, CONSERV BIOL, V21, P986, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00722.x; Foster J, 2004, GEOGR REV, V94, P178; Bradshaw GA, 2001, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V16, P460, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02204-2; Davis MA, 2003, BIOSCIENCE, V53, P481, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0481:BGDCFI]2.0.CO;2; Larson BMH, 2007, BIOL INVASIONS, V9, P947, DOI 10.1007/s10530-007-9095-z; Simberloff D, 2006, ECOL LETT, V9, P912, DOI 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00939.x; Maguire LA, 2004, RISK ANAL, V24, P859, DOI 10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00484.x; Robbins P, 2004, GEOGR REV, V94, P139; Zavaleta ES, 2001, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V16, P454, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02194-2; Larson BMH, 2005, FRONT ECOL ENVIRON, V3, P495; Didham RK, 2005, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V20, P470, DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2005.07.006; Regan TJ, 2006, ECOL LETT, V9, P759, DOI 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00920.x; Simberloff D, 2005, J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC, V18, P595, DOI 10.1007/s10806-005-2851-0; MacDougall AS, 2005, ECOLOGY, V86, P42, DOI 10.1890/04-0669; Cassey P, 2005, AUSTRAL ECOL, V30, P475, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01505.x; Brown JH, 2004, AUSTRAL ECOL, V29, P530, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01340.x; Peretti JH, 1998, ENVIRON VALUE, V7, P183, DOI 10.3197/096327198129341537; Sax DF, 2002, AM NAT, V160, P766, DOI 10.1086/343877; Burgman MA, 2007, BIOL CONSERV, V134, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.08.005; Noss RF, 2007, CONSERV BIOL, V21, P18, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00637.x; Bardsley D., 2006, GeoJournal, V65, P199, DOI 10.1007/s10708-005-2755-6; Botkin DB, 2001, WEST N AM NATURALIST, V61, P261; Brown JH, 2005, AUSTRAL ECOL, V30, P481, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01504.x; Brunson Mark W., 2000, P229; Clements DR, 2007, CAN J PLANT SCI, V87, P989; Clergeau P, 2006, SCIENCE, V311, P951; Crist E, 2004, ENVIRON ETHICS, V26, P5; Cronon W, 1995, UNCOMMON GROUND, P69; Fischer A, 2007, BIOL CONSERV, V135, P256, DOI 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.10.026; Fleming PA, 2006, RELIG NEW ECOLOGY EN, P199; Gobster P.

Modem societies are confronted to the challenges of disappearing natural resources, fierce competition on global markets, and climate change. In this paper we define 'good', and at the same time 'ethical' decisions in the 21st century as being in accordance with the principles of Sustainable Development. Operations Research can assist sustainable decision-making in two ways: (1) through the tools of systems thinking, in particular system dynamics and soft system modelling, to provide insight into the way complex non-linear living systems and human societies function, and help making sustainable decisions, and (2) through educating and training young people in systems thinking. The paper presents examples of simple models that could serve in classrooms.","[Kunsch, P. L.; Brans, J.

The justification for the combined use of MCDM and separate techniques from systems thinking is discussed. The contribution of this paper is in the demonstration of how combinations of methods that are parts of soft systems methodologies and MCDM may support multiple perspective representations of complex managerial problems, and in the lessons learned from the three cases.

Working with a mentor and with clinic and medical group leaders, he established a clear goal, focused on a repeatable and important performance measure, and used repeated rapid cycle trials to make systems changes in care, with extensive task delegation to team members and emphasis on repeated testing and treatment intensification. The composite outcome measure requires that each diabetes patient meet all 5 of the following: LDL < 100, HbA(1c) < 7, systolic blood pressure < 130, regular aspirin use, and tobacco-free status. Results: Over a 24-month period, quarterly measures for this physician's patients rose from 5.7% to 42.9%, while the 7000 diabetes patients of the entire medical group only increased from 4.2% to 12.1%. The change for those patients who stayed under his care for the entire period was even more dramatic - from 2.3% to 46.5% ( P = <. 0001). The largest improvements were for smoking documentation, aspirin use, and LDL control, with little change in HbA(1c) levels. Conclusion: One physician can accomplish a lot, if improvement is approached both systematically and persistently and if the work is coordinated with and supported by practice leaders.","Hlth Partners Res Fdn, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA; Hlth Partners Med Grp, Minneapolis, MN USA","Solberg, LI (reprint author), Hlth Partners Res Fdn, POB 1524,Mailstop 21111R, Minneapolis, MN 55440 USA.",Leif.I.Solberg@HealthPartners.com,,,,,"Amundson Gail M, 2003, Minn Med, V86, P50; Egede LE, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P427, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.4.427; Berwick DM, 2003, MED CARE, V41, pI30; Keating NL, 2004, MED CARE, V42, P829, DOI 10.1097/01.mlr.0000135829.73795.a7; Steiner JF, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V294, P2901, DOI 10.1001/jama.294.22.2901; Berwick DM, 1998, ANN INTERN MED, V128, P651; Berwick DM, 2003, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V289, P1969, DOI 10.1001/jama.289.15.1969; Fireman B, 2004, HEALTH AFFAIR, V23, P63, DOI 10.1377/hlthhaff.23.6.63; O'Connor PJ, 2003, ARCH INTERN MED, V163, P2677, DOI 10.1001/archinte.163.22.2677; Ofman JJ, 2004, AM J MED, V117, P182, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.03.018; Glasgow RE, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P33, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.1.33; Saaddine JB, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P465; O'Connor PJ, 2005, ANN FAM MED, V3, P300, DOI 10.1370/afm.327; Brun E, 2000, DIABETES CARE, V23, P1119, DOI 10.2337/diacare.23.8.1119; Bodenheimer T, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P1775, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.14.1775; Nolan T, 2006, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V295, P1168, DOI 10.1001/jama.295.10.1168; Kiefe CI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2871, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.22.2871; Bodenheimer T, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P1909, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.15.1909; Berlowitz DR, 2005, HEALTH SERV RES, V40, P1836, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00436.x; Bodenheimer Thomas, 2004, Jt Comm J Qual Saf, V30, P505; Fox CS, 2004, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V292, P2495, DOI 10.1001/jama.292.20.2495; Gilmer TP, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P59, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.1.59; Helseth LD, 1999, J FAM PRACTICE, V48, P37; Hiss RG, 1996, ANN INTERN MED, V124, P146; Imperatore G, 2004, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V160, P531, DOI 10.1093/aje/kwh232; LANGLEY GJ, 1994, QUAL PROG, V27, P81; Langley GJ, 1996, IMPROVEMENT GUIDE PR; Larme AC, 2001, DIABETES CARE, V24, P1728, DOI 10.2337/diacare.24.10.1728; O'Connor P J, 1998, J Fam Pract, V47, pS13; O'Connor PJ, 2001, DIS MANAG HEALTH OUT, V9, P691, DOI 10.2165/00115677-200109120-00003; O'Connor PJ, 2005, HEALTH SERV RES, V40, P1854, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00437.x; OCONNOR PJ, 2005, ADV PATIENT SAFETY R, P293; O'Connor Patrick J, 2002, J Am Board Fam Pract, V15, P334; O'Connor PJ, 2003, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V15, P283, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzg062; Perlin JB, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P525; Savage PJ, 1999, DIABETES CARE, V22, P1769, DOI 10.2337/diacare.22.11.1769; Solberg LI, 1997, ANN BEHAV MED, V19, P271, DOI 10.1007/BF02892291; Sperl-Hillen J, 2000, Jt Comm J Qual Improv, V26, P615; Sperl-Hillen JM, 2005, AM J MANAG CARE, V11, pS177; Streja DA, 1999, ARCH INTERN MED, V159, P294, DOI 10.1001/archinte.159.3.294",40,7,9,4,11,AMER BOARD FAMILY MEDICINE,LEXINGTON,"2228 YOUNG DR, LEXINGTON, KY 40505 USA",1557-2625,,,J AM BOARD FAM MED,J.

In this study, we apply Mitroff and Linstone's Unbounded Systems Thinking (UST) framework to a Vietnamese company case. Causal mapping and group model building were used. As the case shows, each perspective provides a limited model of the problem situation. Our study shows that a model built on multiple perspectives offers a more complete picture of the problem and therefore helps the organization better understand the problem situation, creating a ground for better problem resolution. Lessons learned from the case are discussed.","Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Sch Ind Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE USA","Vo, HV (reprint author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Sch Ind Management, 268 Ly Thuong Kiet,10th Dist, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",vhuy@hcmut.edu.vn,,,,,"Abernethy M.

Thinking systems always learn. Healthcare can be considered a paradigm of the thinking system and is repeatedly plagued with unintended, adverse outcomes, particularly fixes that fail. Systems thinking can dissolve such dysfunction in healthcare and by extension in any thinking system. Specific recommendations follow from this rationale.

The paper argues that the scientific method is most usefully interpreted as a dialectic between analysis and synthesis supported by the triadic logic of C.S. Peirce, and that the role of systems thinking is to frame this dialectic. Three generic forms of the system concept are identified -closed systems, input-output systems and open systems. Consequently, systems thinking is shown to play a central role in mainstream science. The paper concludes that a system is best defined as a cognitive construct for making sense of complexity and the organization of knowledge and that contemporary system thinking is best identified as the ethical, scientific pursuit of knowledge using the socio-ecological (open) systems frame.

It first explains the Systems Thinking concept and briefly outlines its history and emergence in agriculture and natural resource management. A series of case studies are then presented which illustrate practical examples of how Systems Thinking has been used to address real life natural resource management issues. The case studies build on the conclusions of each other by adding additional ways (lessons learnt) of incorporating Systems Thinking into practice to address issues more systemically. The first case study deals with examples of how Systems Thinking facilitated the sharing and integration of disparate sources and forms of knowledge, and making sense of the factors influencing tree density in the tropical savanna region of northern Queensland. The second case study deals with how Systems Thinking has been imbedded in the design and implementation of a research project investigating how to improve financial returns to smallholder tree farmers in the Philippines. The third case study illustrates how Systems Thinking was used to design and facilitate an adaptive rodent management project in Cambodia based on participatory research, development and extension. From these experiences, the authors' highlight a variety of key points that lead to the proposition that Systems Thinking should be 'absorbed' into scientific research, in the same way that statistics, is today an integral part of all sciences. A framework for the application of Systems Thinking is presented to help improve sustainable land management.

This is exemplified by the illustration and validation of two learning sequences.","Padogogische Hsch Karlsruhe, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany","Arndt, H (reprint author), Padogogische Hsch Karlsruhe, Bismarckstr 10, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",holger@arndt-sowi.de,,,,,"ANGLIN G, 2004, HDB RES ED COMMUNICA; van Joolingen WR, 2005, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V21, P671, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.039; RICHMOND B, 1993, SYST DYNAM REV, V9, P113, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260090203; Renkl A, 1996, EDUC PSYCHOL, V31, P115, DOI 10.1207/s15326985ep3102_3; ARNDT H, 2005, 4 UNT WIRTSCH; ARNDT H, 2005, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEM; ARNDT H, 2007, SYSTEM DYNAMICS SCHU; AVOURIS N, 2003, P 6 INT C COMP BAS L; BERENDES K, 2002, LENKUNGSKOMPETENZ KO; Bliss J, 1994, LEARNING ARTIFICIAL; Bruner J., 1963, KNOWING ESSAYS LEFT; Collins A., 1989, KNOWING LEARNING INS; Duffy T.

These theories come from different perspectives that either focus on management, economic or social sciences and create a complex net. This complexity often makes managers take a decision, the outcome of which contradicts their original aims. The objectives of this paper are to communicate innovation theory to the different actors in the system under a common perspective and to reveal the complexity of innovation systems. The new concept has at its centre the firm, which is the generator and promoter of innovations in the market, the industrial sector and the nation. The model's main focus is the Knowledge Creation from public or industrial research; the New Product Design and Development process, and the Product Success in the market. This process is affected by other internal factors of the firm as well as by the National Innovation Environment. This innovation system has been codified, under a system dynamics approach, to create a model, the 'Creative Factory' that includes all the aspects that academia, a firm or the policy making bodies need to consider around innovation activity.

This paper presents an alternative approach to IS planning based on critical systems thinking - a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholders' understandings of social contexts prior to the selection and/or design of planning methods. The approach is underpinned by a combination of the systems theories of autopoiesis and boundary critique, and it enables participants to reflect on different concerns and values during IS planning. This approach was applied in a project with a Colombian University, and it helped participants to uncover and address important human issues not usually seen as relevant by traditional approaches to IS planning. In addition, it led the authors to undertake further research on ethics after the project had been concluded.","Univ Hull, Sch Business, Ctr Syst Studies, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; Inst Environm Sci & Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; Univ Victoria, Wellington, New Zealand","Cordoba, JR (reprint author), Univ Hull, Sch Business, Ctr Syst Studies, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",J.R.Cordoba@hull.ac.uk,,,,,"Ackoff R.

Recent research (Reich and Benbasat [56]) indicates that building a shared understanding between business and IS executives is one way of strengthening this alignment. This paper describes a study that examines the cognitive basis of shared understanding between business and IS executives. Using Personal Construct Theory (Kelly [36]), this study uses cognitive mapping techniques to explore the commonalities and individualities in the cognition between these executives. Eighty business and IS executives in six companies participated in this study. The results indicate that a higher level of cognitive commonality is positively related to a higher level of business-IS alignment. This is supported by findings that greater diversity in cognitive structure and cognitive content of business and IS executives coincide with a lower level of alignment. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.","Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Auckland 1020, New Zealand; Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Tan, FB (reprint author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1020, New Zealand.",felix.tan@aut.ac.nz,,,,,"REGER RK, 1993, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V14, P103, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250140203; Moynihan T, 1996, J INFORM TECHNOL, V11, P359; Tan FB, 2002, MIS QUART, V26, P39, DOI 10.2307/4132340; LUFTMAN JN, 1993, IBM SYST J, V32, P198; BOYNTON AC, 1994, MIS QUART, V18, P299, DOI 10.2307/249620; Henderson JC, 1999, IBM SYST J, V38, P472; DESANCTIS G, 1994, ORGAN SCI, V5, P121, DOI 10.1287/orsc.5.2.121; ORLIKOWSKI WJ, 1994, ACM T INFORM SYST, V12, P174, DOI 10.1145/196734.196745; Palmer JW, 2000, INFORM SYST RES, V11, P241, DOI 10.1287/isre.11.3.241.12203; REYNOLDS TJ, 1988, J ADVERTISING RES, V28, P11; TAN FB, 1995, J INFORM TECHNOL, V10, P171; Reich BH, 2000, MIS QUART, V24, P81, DOI 10.2307/3250980; LANGFIELD-SMITH K, 1992, J MANAGE STUD, V29, P349; Kearns GS, 2003, DECISION SCI, V34, P1, DOI 10.1111/1540-5915.02289; ARNOLD J, 1991, J ORGAN BEHAV, V12, P621, DOI 10.1002/job.4030120706; Bannister D, 1968, EVALUATION PERSONAL; Bougon M.

Awareness of and support for systems thinking-and modeling in the public health field are growing, yet there are many practical challenges to implementation. We sought to identify and describe these challenges from the perspectives of practicing public health professionals. Methods. A systems-based methodology, concept mapping, was used in a study of 133 participants from 2 systems-based public health initiatives (the Initiative for the Study and Implementation of Systems and the Syndemics Prevention Network). This method identified 100 key challenges to implementation of systems thinking and modeling in public health work. Results. The project resulted in a map identifying 8 categories of challenges and the dynamic interactions among them. Conclusions. Implementation by public health professionals of the 8 simple rules we derived from the clusters in the map identified here will help to address challenges and improve the organization of systems that protect the public's health.","Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Educ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; Gallagher & Assoc, Ithaca, NY USA; NCI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Trochim, WM (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, 249 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",wmt1@cornell.edu,"Trochim, William/A-1250-2007","Trochim, William/0000-0003-0369-2922",,,"*AM RED CROSS, 2002, CPR AED PROF RESC; Anderberg M.R., 1973, CLUSTER ANAL APPL; [Anonymous], 2001, BMJ, V323; Anderson RA, 2000, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V25, P83; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P746; Schmidt G, 1999, LANCET, V353, P1390, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)08428-1; Goldberger AL, 1996, LANCET, V347, P1312, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90948-4; Plsek PE, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P625, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7313.625; TROCHIM WMK, 1989, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V12, P1, DOI 10.1016/0149-7189(89)90016-5; Cole CR, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V341, P1351, DOI 10.1056/NEJM199910283411804; Dekker JM, 2000, CIRCULATION, V102, P1239; Bammer G, 2005, ECOL SOC, V10; Godin PJ, 1996, CRIT CARE MED, V24, P1107, DOI 10.1097/00003246-199607000-00008; Stokols D, 1996, HEALTH EDUC QUART, V23, P137, DOI 10.1177/109019819602300202; Miller WL, 1998, J FAM PRACTICE, V46, P369; Emirbayer M, 1997, AM J SOCIOL, V103, P281, DOI 10.1086/231209; Anderson RA, 2003, NURS RES, V52, P12, DOI 10.1097/00006199-200301000-00003; Goldberger AL, 1997, PERSPECT BIOL MED, V40, P543; Singer M, 2003, MED ANTHROPOL Q, V17, P423, DOI 10.1525/maq.2003.17.4.423; [Anonymous], 1966, ACC DEATH DIS NEGL D; Wakefield MA, 2002, AM J PUBLIC HEALTH, V92, P937, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.92.6.937; RICHMOND B, 1993, SYST DYNAM REV, V9, P113, DOI 10.1002/sdr.4260090203; Ivanov PC, 1999, NATURE, V399, P461, DOI 10.1038/20924; Ashmos DP, 2000, HEALTH CARE MANAGE R, V25, P109; Baer H., 2003, MED ANTHR WORLD SYST; Baskin K, 2000, Physician Exec, V26, P20; Batterham R, 2002, SOC SCI MED, V54, P1225, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00092-2; Beguns JW, 2002, ADV HLT CARE ORG THE, P253; CABRERA DA, BACTERIAL BURRITOS M; CABRERA DA, 2002, CREATING LEARNING CO; *CAL ENH AUD SYST, 1991, TURN POINT TRANSF VI; CAPRA F, 1994, PARTS WHOLE SYSTEMS; Capra F., 2002, HIDDEN CONNECTIONS I; Capra F., 1997, WEB LIFE NEW SYNTHES; *CDCP, 2001, SPOTL SYND; CLARK PI, 2003, REPORT WHO SCI ADVIS, P1; Committee on Assuring the Health of the Public in the 21st Century, 2002, FUT PUBL HLTH 21 CEN; COTE M, 2002, CA MAGAZINE      MAR; DARDIK I, 1997, FRONTIER PERSPECTIVE, V6, P18; DAVIDZ HL, 2004, ENABLERS BARRIERS PR; Davison M.

It requires businesspersons and other decision makers to be broad and hence to apply inter-disciplinarity incorporating many, mutually partly different and therefore interdependent, viewpoints for requisite holism. To do so, they should use systems thinking. But the modern diversity of systems theories, including cybernetics, opens the issue: which systems theory and/or cybernetic should one use? Aims to discuss the dialectical systems theory (DST), its definition of holism and its definition of the seven principal groups of notions making systems thinking possible, when applied in a synergy. This may lead to a requisite holism, and hence to efficiency and effectiveness of the work on and of the CSR; it has often been done so in the 30 years of DST. Design/methodology/approach - Desk research and indirect field research were used. The concept of CSR is a rather soft topic. It demands a holistic treatment and hence a plural theoretical foundation following recent trends in economics (business and environmental), management as well as systems thinking. The problem was investigated empirically from the systems-oriented perspective supported by DST, because it tackles human personality and impacts over it and by it, rather than offers tools for people to use for whatever purposes. Findings - The CSR concept belongs in sociocyberbetics; linking cybernetics, systems theory and social aspects of the reality. The definition of CSR requires humans to think, decide, and act on a very broad basis rather than to reduce their horizons to the narrow habit of businesses to find profit only essential. CSR links the hard-systemic and soft-systemic versions of modem systems theories. It could be seen as an attribute of human personality and as a process between humans and organisations. Research limitations/implications - As CSR has many dimensions (economic, environmental and social ones, at least), the research focused on the requisitely holistic performance of an organisation being aware of diversified needs of multi-stakeholders (including its own employees, as well). Practical implications - The research findings and conclusions can support endeavors to implement the CSR concept in practice: in organisations, among different stakeholders and broader public audience (including governmental institutions and communities). Originality/value - The paper provides the theoretical foundation to raise and improve socially responsible activities by supporting a maturing management philosophy approaching the viable, balanced organisation.","Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Knez-Riedl, J (reprint author), Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",jozica.knez@uni-mb.si,,,,,"Ackoff R, 2003, REDESIGNING SOC; AHLEMEYER HW, 2000, J SOCIOCYBERNETICS, V1, P1; Mulej M, 2003, CYBERNET SYST, V34, P71, DOI 10.1080/01969720390180212; Mulej M, 2004, KYBERNETES, V33, P48, DOI 10.1108/03684920410514346; ANTONY G, 2004, STIQE, P13; BALIUNAS S, 2002, KYOTO PROTOCOL GLOBA; BAUSCH C, 2003, ISSS47; BAUSCH K, 2003, 47 ANN C INT SOC SYS; BERTALANFFY VL, 1979, GEN SYSTEMS; BOCKSTAELE JV, 2000, J SOCIOCYBERNETICS, V1, P17; BOSKOVIC D, 2004, DELO SOBOTNA PR 0616, P7; Buble M, 2003, MANAGEMENT, V8, P1; BUCHINGER E, 2004, 5 INT C SOC SOC KNOW; CAVNICAR M, 2003, NASE GOSPODARSTVO, V49, P175; Collins J., 2001, GOOD GREAT WHY SOME; *CSR, 2004, K DRUZB ODG PODJ C C; Davidson M., 1983, UNCOMMON SENSE LIFE; Delgado R.

Mitroff and Linstone [The Unbounded Mind: Breaking the Chains of Traditional Business Thinking (1993) Oxford University Press, New York] developed Unbounded Systems Thinking (UST), of which multiple perspectives are an integral part. They suggest that, while the theory of applying multiple perspectives to decision-making and knowledge creation is sound and well researched, the implementation of multiple perspectives is difficult. It is maintained here that agent-oriented modeling can be used to design a system supporting multiple perspectives and to extend UST. This paper applies the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agents to UST to demonstrate the use of agent-oriented modeling to facilitate multiple perspective decision support.

The results have consistently shown that people have poor understanding of system concepts.

Students answered the questions before and after a course that takes 13 weeks.

The sample population included about 50 eighth-grade students from two different classes of an urban Israeli junior high school who studied an earth systems-based curriculum that focused on the hydro cycle. The study addressed the following research questions: (a) Could the students deal with complex systems?; (b) What has influenced the students' ability to deal with system perception?; and (c) What are the relationship among the cognitive components of system thinking? The research combined qualitative and quantitative methods and involved various research tools, which were implemented in order to collect the data concerning the students' knowledge and understanding before, during, and following the learning process. The findings indicated that the development of system thinking in the context of the earth systems consists of several sequential stages arranged in a hierarchical structure. The cognitive skills that are developed in each stage serve as the basis for the development of the next higher-order thinking skills. The research showed that in spite of the minimal initial system thinking abilities of the students most of them made some meaningful progress in their system thinking skills, and a third of them reached the highest level of system thinking in the context of the hydro cycle.

To check or reverse the existing trends, the construction of a new administrative capital is being actively discussed. Without due policy designs and application processes, however, the current discussions are not fully adequate in explaining why a new administrative capital is necessary and how it could benefit more balanced regional development. In an effort to address the issue, analytical logics for the proposed new administrative capital are developed using qualitative system dynamics models. To provide policy guidelines, urban dynamics caused by the construction are also analyzed, which include the expected growth and maturity of the new administrative capital city. The research findings indicate that policy intentionally geared towards more balanced regional development through the construction of the new administrative capital city depends on the government's supporting policies that can address and accommodate changes in the regional development system. It is concluded that the system approaches presented here could assist the government in developing robust and responsive policy initiatives given current uncertainties.

Although the industry is a major player in meeting infrastructural needs of Canadians, it is also a major user of natural resources such as water, natural minerals, and aggregates. Moreover, for each tonne of cement clinker produced, 1 t of CO2 is released into the atmosphere. At the same time, Canada produces nearly 5 million tonnes of fly ash each year, and yet the use of fly ash as cement replacement remains dismally low at around 17%. It is believed that through product and process innovations, more fly ash can be used in concrete, thus preserving natural resources, reducing CO2 emissions, and helping Canada meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Forecasting the future impact of using fly ash in concrete has been based on qualitative and linear estimates, however, without accounting for the complexity of the problem and its dynamic feedbacks. In this paper, a novel application of system dynamics modeling, a feedback-based object-oriented modeling paradigm, is proposed to create a rational model that departs from current approaches used in modeling CO2 emissions of cement production. The model accounts for the various enablers and barriers for using fly ash in concrete, including market dynamics and technology development. It allows the user to test a wide variety of scenarios and policies, its flexible architecture permits coupling it with general economic or service life models, and its modular nature allows expanding its boundaries to include other facets of the holistic CO2 emissions problem in Canada.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada","Nehdi, M (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",mnehdi@eng.uwo.ca,"Nehdi, Moncef/D-3480-2013","Nehdi, Moncef/0000-0002-2561-993X",,,"Aitcin PC, 2000, CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY FOR A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY, P206; [Anonymous], 1998, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, DOI 10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00019-5; Worrell E, 2001, ANNU REV ENERG ENV, V26, P303, DOI 10.1146/annurev.energy.26.1.303; *BATT MEM I, 2002, INN CAN HELP CEM IND; BENTZ EC, 2001, LIFE 365 MANUAL LIFE; *CAC, 2001, CONCR SOL MOR SUST I; Coyle R.

End-users may prefer the autonomy they gain by having more control over their business responsibilities; however, at the same time they may feel isolated. As a result of ""end-user isolation"" the need for social interaction becomes more pronounced creating ""end-user distraction."" This is counterproductive to the intended goals of the IT investment. Qualitative data from a case study are used to demonstrate the importance of identifying both intended and unintended consequences of IT implementation. The paper employs a systems thinking approach to explain how unintended effects such as unproductive social habits can be predicted and prevented. A key result of the study is that ironically, end-users discover ways to use IT as a social mechanism. Managerial implications of this study are discussed that can help both IT practitioners and management when implementing packaged software in small businesses.","Hofstra Univ, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA","Binbasioglu, M (reprint author), Hofstra Univ, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",,,,,,"Agar M., 1986, SPEAKING ETHNOGRAPHY; Trauth EM, 2000, MIS QUART, V24, P43, DOI 10.2307/3250979; SENGE PM, 1992, EUR J OPER RES, V59, P137, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(92)90011-W; CHAO GT, 1994, J APPL PSYCHOL, V79, P730, DOI 10.1037//0021-9010.79.5.730; ATTEWELL P, 1984, COMMUN ACM, V27, P1184, DOI 10.1145/2135.2136; Bergeron F., 1992, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V30, P21; Binbasioglu M, 1999, J COMPUT INFORM SYST, V40, P54; Binbasioglu M, 2003, EXPERT SYST APPL, V25, P517, DOI 10.1016/S0957-4174(03)00092-7; Binbasioglu M, 1997, J COMPUT INFORM SYST, V37, P89; BRETT JM, 1984, JOB TRANSITION PERSO, P155; CLEMENT A, 1994, COMMUN ACM, V37, P52, DOI 10.1145/175222.175226; DELONE WH, 1988, MIS Q, V12, P151; Doukidis G.

It is based on the authors' recent work on the Demonstrating Values project with the New Zealand Customs Service, which involved integrating critical thinking and systems thinking into the policy development process. Critical thinking is used in this context to reconstruct a rationale for a given policy. This helped us to isolate key concepts and desired outcomes. The concepts were then used to construct a conceptual diagram. Based on this, the key concepts were operationalised to form a causal loop diagram including the main variables of interest in the system. The causal loop diagram can then be used as the basis for further policy interventions and analysis.

However, usage of system dynamics remains low, which questions the true value that policy-makers gain from the approach as currently delivered. Feedback systems thinking and causal loop diagrams currently dominate the representation of problem situations. Although substantial benefits are claimed for this approach, it embeds serious theoretical and pedagogical flaws, notably by separating the problem behaviour from the structure alleged to cause it, by ignoring scale and timing of behaviour, and by excluding the fundamental and unavoidable properties of asset stock accumulation. Policy-makers are thus unlikely to be provided with actionable solutions, whether from feedback diagrams alone or from subsequent simulation models, a failure that may have irretrievably alienated a significant fraction of management who have been exposed to system dynamics.

Minorsky [2003] Plant Physiol 132: 404-409) offered a welcomed advocacy for systems analysis as essential in understanding plant development, growth, and production. The goal of the Workshop was to consider methods for relating the results of molecular research to real-world challenges in plant production for increased food supplies, alternative energy sources, and environmental improvement. The rather surprising feature of this report, however, was that the Workshop largely overlooked the rich history of plant systems analysis extending over nearly 40 years (Sinclair and Seligman, 1996) that has considered exactly those challenges targeted by the Workshop. Past systems research has explored and incorporated biochemical and physiological knowledge into plant simulation models from a number of perspectives. The research has resulted in considerable understanding and insight about how to simulate plant systems and the relative contribution of various factors in influencing plant production. These past activities have contributed directly to research focused on solving the problems of increasing biomass production and crop yields. These modeling approaches are also now providing an avenue to enhance integration of molecular genetic technologies in plant improvement (Hammer et al., 2002).","Univ Florida, USDA ARS, Agron Physiol Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Commonwlth Sci & Ind Res Org Plant Ind, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; Queensland Dept Primary Ind, Agr Prod Syst Res Unit, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; Univ Queensland, Sch Land & Food Sci, Agr Prod Syst Res Unit, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Sinclair, TR (reprint author), Univ Florida, USDA ARS, Agron Physiol Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",trsincl@ifas.ufl.edu,"Hammer, Graeme/A-3785-2008; Chapman, Scott/B-9673-2008","Hammer, Graeme/0000-0002-1180-7374; Chapman, Scott/0000-0003-4732-8452",,,"DEWIT CT, 1983, NETH J AGR SCI, V31, P313; Chapman S, 2003, AGRON J, V95, P99; Katagiri F, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V132, P417, DOI 10.1104/pp.103.021774; Giaever G, 2002, NATURE, V418, P387, DOI 10.1038/nature00935; SINCLAIR TR, 1989, CROP SCI, V29, P90; Davidson EH, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P1669, DOI 10.1126/science.1069883; Ideker T, 2001, SCIENCE, V292, P929, DOI 10.1126/science.292.5518.929; Wang E, 2002, EUR J AGRON, V18, P121, DOI 10.1016/S1161-0301(02)00100-4; JACOB F, 1977, SCIENCE, V196, P1161, DOI 10.1126/science.860134; Donatelli M, 2002, EUR J AGRON, V18, P1, DOI 10.1016/S1161-0301(02)00104-1; Thum KE, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V132, P440, DOI 10.1104/pp.103.022780; Sinclair TR, 1996, AGRON J, V88, P698; Reymond M, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V131, P664, DOI 10.1104/pp.013839; Tardieu F, 2003, TRENDS PLANT SCI, V8, P9, DOI 10.1016/S1360-1385(02)00008-0; Hammer GL, 2002, EUR J AGRON, V18, P15, DOI 10.1016/S1161-0301(02)00093-X; von Dassow G, 2000, NATURE, V406, P188, DOI 10.1038/35018085; Borrell A, 2001, ANN APPL BIOL, V138, P91, DOI 10.1111/j.1744-7348.2001.tb00088.x; Cooper Mark, 2002, In Silico Biology, V2, P151; Gell-Mann M., 1994, QUARK JAGUAR ADVENTU; Leon AJ, 2001, THEOR APPL GENET, V102, P497, DOI 10.1007/s001220051673; Minorsky PV, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V132, P404, DOI 10.1104/pp.900076; Morandini P, 2003, TRENDS PLANT SCI, V8, P70, DOI 10.1016/S1360-1385(02)00027-4; Nemhauser JL, 2003, PLANT PHYSIOL, V132, P436, DOI 10.1104/pp.102.017061; Snape J, 2001, ANN APPL BIOL, V138, P203, DOI 10.1111/j.1744-7348.2001.tb00103.x; Weiss A, 2003, AGRON J, V95, P1",25,72,75,1,8,AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,ROCKVILLE,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",0032-0889,,,PLANT PHYSIOL,Plant Physiol.,MAR,2004,134,3,,,,,909,911,,10.1104/pp.103.034827,,3,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,805IQ,WOS:000220360400005,15020754J,"Maani, KE; Maharaj, V",,,,"Maani, KE; Maharaj, V",,,Links between systems thinking and complex decision making,SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROCESS TRACING METHODS; MISPERCEPTIONS; INTERVENTIONS; DYNAMICS; FEEDBACK,"There is a widely held belief that systems thinking is an answer to the increasing complexity of the world as well as the workplace. Despite strong interest and assertions, however, the relationship between systems thinking and complex decision making has received scant attention in the literature. Using Richmond's (1997) classification scheme as the theoretical base, this paper investigates the link between systems thinking and complex decision making using Verbal Protocol Analysis (VPA) methodology. The findings of the study indicate that while the degree of systems thinking does matter, certain types of systemic thinking would be more relevant to performance. Further, evidence shows that the subject's approach to the problem is also a highly pertinent factor in task performance, in that better performers displayed a distinctive pattern of thought that differed from that of the poor performers. Better performing subjects attempted to gain an understanding of the system structure before they proceeded to develop strategies and take action. The findings revealed a cyclical thought pattern that was consistently followed by better performing participants. This pattern, termed the CPA cycle, consists of three distinct phases of conception, planning, and action. This research contributes to the fields of systems thinking and complex decision making by integrating knowledge and methodology from several disciplines including psychology, management and IT. Specific contributions include a novel research methodology and, in particular, operationalization of the systems thinking paradigm, as well as identification of disaggregated factors affecting complex decision making. The managerial and organizational implications of the research are compelling and invite further research in this nascent field.

During the period of 1980-1995, the textile industry in the United States was flourishing. It was during these times, that increased regulatory pressures initiated aquatic toxicity testing of wastewater discharges from publicly owned treatment works. Resolution of problems identified by these tests required the development of new toxicity assessment tools, and the use of systems thinking and community/industry/regulator dialogues. The case for the beneficial use of these tools is presented as an example of how to increase productivity through greener (environmentally conservative) production induced by cooperative stakeholder actions.

However, the plethora of both conceptual and practitioner literature has provided little consistency regarding key definitions or methodologies that can act to guide practice. This can result in practitioners selecting particular ideas, constructs or language that has weak conceptual grounding and result in ephemeral and 'ad hoc' practices. This paper analyses the use of systems thinking for 'knowledge management' practices because it is argued to have the potential to provide methodological guidance for practitioners. The context of the research in the paper is in the humanitarian sector, and in operations that are often politically messy and complex, where there are often many unknown factors. it is a context in which knowledge in a broad sense of the word, as in any human activity, plays an instrumental role.

Accordingly, the essence of the current reform in STIES education, worldwide, is a purposed effort to develop students' higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS) capability; i.e., question-asking, critical system thinking, decision making and problem solving, at the expense of the ""delivery"" of lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS)-oriented knowledge. This means a paradigm shift from the contemporary prevalent LOCS algorithmic teaching to HOCS evaluative learning and HOCS-promoting courses, curricula, teaching strategies and assessment methodologies, leading, hopefully to evaluative thinking and transfer. Following the formulation of selected relevant axioms, major paradigm shift in STES research and education for sustainability have been identified. The consequent shift, in the STIES context, from disciplinary to inter- and transdisciplinary learning, in science technology and environmental engineering education is discussed, followed by selected examples of successfully implemented HOCS-promoting courses, and assessment methodologies. It is argued, that transferable ""HOCS learning"" for sustainability can and should be done.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci & Sci Educ Chem, IL-36006 Qiryat Tivon, Israel; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Nat & Social Interface UNS, Dept Environm Sci, ETH Zentrum HAD, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Zoller, U (reprint author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci & Sci Educ Chem, IL-36006 Qiryat Tivon, Israel.",uriz@research.haifa.ac.il; roland.scholz@uns.umnw.ethz.ch,"Scholz, Roland/B-2076-2008",,,,"ZOLLER U, 1993, J CHEM EDUC, V70, P195; Scholz RW, 2004, J RES SCI TEACH, V41, P24, DOI 10.1002/tea.10123; BURANDT S, 2003, TRANSDIZIPLINARE FAL; FRISCHKNECHT P, 2000, TRANSDISCIPLINARITY, V1, P629; FRISCHKNECHT PM, 2002, UMGANG UMWELTSYSTEME; Gibbons M., 1994, NEW PRODUCTION KNOWL; Gibbons M, 2001, TRANSDISCIPLINARITY, P67; LAWS D, 2002, 30 ETH ZUR UMW UMW; OBERLE BM, 1997, GAIA, V5, P73; SCHOLZ RW, 2002, LUNDBY MOVE MOBILITY; SCHOLZ RW, 1997, J ENVIRON EDUC, V28, P37; SCHOLZ RW, 2003, REGION APPENZELL AUS; Tietje O., 2002, EMBEDDED CASE STUDY; Welti M., 2000, TRANSDISCIPLINARITY, P13; Zoller U., 1990, HIGHER ED EUROPE, V15, P5, DOI 10.1080/0379772900150402; ZOLLER U, 2003, UNPUB ENV SCI TECHNO; Zoller U, 2002, INT J SCI EDUC, V24, P185, DOI 10.1080/09500690110049060; Zoller U, 2000, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V7, P63, DOI 10.1007/BF02987668; Zoller U, 2001, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V8, P1, DOI 10.1007/BF02987286; ZOLLER U, 2002, UNPUB J CHEM ED; ZOLLER U, 1999, J COLL SCI TEACH, V29, P404",21,11,12,3,15,I W A PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

West Churchman's work, this article investigates one of the most cherished endeavours of his thinking: to provide a normative meaning for the conduct of human affiars. Churchman has always emphasized 'What-Ought-To-Be', at the expense of the 'What-Is'. To achieve this purpose, four Systems Thinking paradigms, namely Hard Systems Thinking, Soft Systems Thinking, Critical Systems Thinking, and Multimodal Systems Thinking, are investigated with regard to their foundations for normative guidance. This investigation is made by identifying their respective basic convictions in the form of so-called 'religious ground-motives', which are based on the assumption that all human thinking and acting starts with a credal conviction, be it Christian, Jew, Islamic, Buddhist, or other. As a result it is found that these systems thinking paradigms are either founded on an inherent contradiction or provide a normative foundation that lacks a social contract for their implementation, and therefore these paradigms do not provide a stable and satisfactory normative guidance for system design. Note: The key claim of this author is that, to be normative, an ethical theory must be grounded in a transcendental justification which is based on some religious faith. The opinions presented in this paper are strictly the author's, who does not claim that his beliefs have more merit or are more ethical than those of any competitive faiths.

Yet, a widespread misconception has taken hold of the OR/MS community: 'critical' and 'emancipatory' systems methodologies are opposed to 'hard' and 'soft' ones as if they were sensible alternatives. Accordingly, adequate 'methodology choice' is now widely considered a key condition of reflective professional practice; critical systems thinking (CST) is understood to deal mainly with this issue. The present paper argues that this conception of CST is neither theoretically sound nor conducive to reflective practice. An examination of the two major current strands of CST suggests some basic requirements of an alternative conception: (1) Reflective practice depends more on a framework of critical argumentation and discourse than on a framework of methodology choice. (2) A well-conceived discursive systems approach will give a proper place to the public sphere. (3) The much-discussed emancipatory orientation of CST inheres in the methodological requirements of discourse rather than in an arbitrary `commitment' on the part of the systems practitioner. (4) Systemic boundary critique-the methodological core concept of critical systems heuristics (CSH)-allows us to translate these requirements into practical methodology. (5) Contrary to present conceptions of methodological pluralism or 'complementarism', boundary critique must not be subordinated to methodology choice, for it is constitutive of all critical inquiry and practice. These considerations lead to a reconstitution of CST, and to a new view of reflective professional practice in general, as critically systemic discourse.","Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Ulrich, W (reprint author), Sichelweg 41, CH-3098 Schlieren, Switzerland.",,,,,,"JACKSON MC, 1990, J OPER RES SOC, V41, P657; KEYS P, 1988, SYST RES, V5, P65, DOI 10.1002/sres.3850050108; CHECKLAND P, 1985, J OPER RES SOC, V36, P757, DOI 10.2307/2582164; Checkland P.

Instead, the starting point is intervention, defined as purposeful action by an agent to create change. While some authors suggest that intervention and observation are opposites, it is argued here that observation ( as undertaken in science) should be viewed as just one type of intervention. We should therefore welcome scientific techniques of observation into a pluralistic set of intervention methods, alongside methods for exploring values, reflecting on subjective understandings, planning future activities, etc. However, there is a need to explicitly counter a possible pernicious interpretation of this argument: intervention could ( erroneously) be viewed as flawlessly preplanned change based on accurate predictions of the consequences of action. This is the mechanistic worldview that systems thinking and complexity science seek to challenge. Therefore, having redefined scientific observation as intervention, the paper revisits insights from systems thinking and complexity to propose a methodology of systemic intervention. Some brief reflections are then provided on the wider social implications of this methodology.","Univ Hull, Sch Business, Ctr Syst Studies, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England","Midgley, G (reprint author), Univ Hull, Sch Business, Ctr Syst Studies, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",,,,,,"Alroe H., 2000, CYBERNETICS HUMAN KN, V7, P57; Midgley G, 1998, J OPER RES SOC, V49, P467, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600531; MIDGLEY G, 1992, SYST PRACTICE, V5, P5, DOI 10.1007/BF01060044; BAGBY JW, 1957, J ABNORM SOC PSYCH, V54, P331, DOI 10.1037/h0046310; Bateson Gregory, 1972, STEPS ECOLOGY MIND; Bohr N., 1963, ESSAYS 1958 1962 ATO; BROWN M, 1996, CRITICAL SYSTEMS THI; BROWN M, 1999, 20 U HULL SCH MAN CT; Casti J.

Success has always depended on holistic rather than one-sided thinking. Empirical findings about the innovative society can exemplify this statement, though there seems to be no universal agreement as to what the basic attributes of systems thinking are, and we offer a summary of them. To test them, we investigated an industrial latecomer country and found that the understanding of both the innovative society and the systemic thinking are rare: one-sidedness prevails. What do we do to come closer to holistic thinking? Neither the General Systems Theory nor most other systems theories (except the Dialectical Systems Theory) provide a methodology supportive of holism; however, the case of the visionary companies proves that informal systems thinking can be very powerful. Hence, systems theories should work more on informal systems thinking.","Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business EPF, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; New Moment DOO, Bezigrad, Slovenia","Mulej, M (reprint author), Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business EPF, POB 142, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",,,,,,"BASTIC M, 2001, REZULTATI ANAL SLOVE; BASTIC M, 1999, IZVEDBENI MANAGEMENT; BELAK J, 1993, UNTERNEHMEN UEBERGAN; BERTALANFFY VL, 1979, GEN SYSTEMS THEORY; BOLE V, 2002, GOSPODARSTVO 2002 ME; BOLWIJN PT, 1990, LONG RANGE PLANN, V23, P44, DOI 10.1016/0024-6301(90)90151-S; Bucar M., 2001, RAZVOJNO DOHITEVANJE; CANCER V, 2001, ENTERPRISE TRANSITIO, P1439; Collins J., 1997, BUILT LAST SUCCESSFU; CUK J, 2001, M INV INN SLOV 5 DEC; Davidson M., 1983, UNCOMMON SENSE LIFE; DEVETAK G, 1980, TEHNOLOSKE INOVACIJE; *DEZAP, 2001, C PRIH NOTR LASTN SL; DYCK R, 1999, SELF TRANSFORMATION; ELOHIM JL, 1999, 10 WOSC C UXBR UK; ELOHIM JL, 2000, P INT C LINK SYST TH; ELOHIM JL, 2002, CYBERNETICS SYSTEMS; EMMERING M, 2002, CYBERNETICS SYSTEMS; *EU, 2000, COMM INN KNOWL DRIV; *EU, 1997, AG 2000 COMM OP SLOV; Forrester Viviane, 1996, HORREUR EC; Grassby Richard, 1999, IDEA CAPITALISM IND; HOFKIRCHNER W, 2001, UNITY DIVERSITY; *IDIMT, 1993, INT INF MAN TALKS; *INT SOC SYST SCI, 2001, 45 C INT SOC SYST SC; Jackson MC, 1991, SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY; JOYCE H, 2002, A SMITH INVISIBLE HA; KAJZER S, 1982, THESIS U ZAGREB CROA; KAJZER S, 1974, THESIS U ZAGREB CROA; KNEZRIEDL J, 2000, ZVEZA RACUNOVODIJ FI, V15; KNEZRIEDL J, 1997, THESIS EPF LJUBLJANA; KRALJIC P, 2002, SLOVENIJA EVROPSKA A, P8; Martin H.-P., 1996, GLOBALISIERUNGSFALLE; MOCNIK U, 1999, PODJETNIK, V15, P3; MULEJ M, 1997, NASE GOSPODARSTVO, V43; MULEJ M, 1998, P INT C LINK SYST TH; MULEJ M, 2000, 17 INT TRANSD C 25 2; MULEJ M, 1981, NOV JUGOSLOVANSKI MO; Mulej M., 1979, USTVARJALNO DELO DIA; Mulej M., 2002, CYBERNETICS SYSTEMS; MULEJ M, 1994, CYBERNET SYST, V25, P861, DOI 10.1080/01969729408902358; Mulej M., 1987, INOVATIVNO POSLOVANJ; MULEJ M, 1981, USOMID; MULEJ N, 2000, 21 PODIM VLOGA INOVI; Mulejs M, 2000, DIALEKTICNA DRUGE ME; Oshry B., 1996, SEEING SYSTEMS UNLOC; Petzinger T., 2000, NEW PIONEERS MEN WOM; PIVKA M, 2000, J KOREAN SOC QUALITY, V28, P242; PIVKA M, 2001, ISO 9000 SLOVENSKIH; PIVKA M, 1998, P INT CLINK SYST THI; PIVKA M, 1999, ISO 9000 KONKURENCNO; POTOCAN V, 2002, ENTSCHEIDEN KOMPLEXE, P221; POTOCAN V, 1999, THESIS EPF; POTOCAN V, 2001, ORGANIZACIJA, V34, P422; REBERNIK M, 2000, KYBERNETES, V29, P1306; REBERNIK M, 2001, 22 PODIM PRENOS NOVO; REBERNIK M, 1990, EKONOMIKA INOVATIVNE; REBERNIK M, 1996, ORIS SODOBNIH PODJET; Rogers E.M, 1995, DIFFUSION INNOVATION; ROSENBERG N, 1986, PAST W GREW RICH; STANIC G, 2001, MANIFEST NOVE EKONOM; TOS N, 1999, CIVILNA DRUZBA SLOVE; TRONCALE L, 2002, CYBERNETICS SYSTEMS; *UMAR, 2001, SLOV NOV DES TRAJN K; URSIC D, 1996, INOVIRANJE PODJETJA; ZENKO Z, 1999, THESIS EPF; ZENKO Z, 1999, SYSTEMICA, V13, P49; *ZRS, 2001, TVEG KAP SLOV 2001 F; 2001, UNESCO COURIER   SEP, P13; 2001, UNESCO COURIER   DEC, P8; 1978, WEBSTERS SCH OFFICE",71,22,22,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0196-9722,,,CYBERNET SYST,Cybern.

Therefore, the issues involved in the deployment of rural telecommunications infrastructure, if all its stakeholders are to benefit, are not always technological, but are often complex and 'messy', cutting across various aspects of the rural society, especially in developing countries. Consequently, the planning of rural telecommunications infrastructure requires an approach that addresses such complexities.

Our preliminary study showed two things about critical systems thinking. First, it provides comprehensive and creative insight into tackling the increasing complexity of human knowledge and knowledge management processes through the organic connection and division of knowledge systems. Second, it encourages the critical use of available methodologies in a coherent way to cope with corresponding subsystems or processes, which breaks down the complexity into convenient units. Based on critical systems thinking, we divided knowledge into two aspects: static substance knowledge and dynamic process knowledge. This division not only provides a concise theoretical framework but also allows knowledge managers and workers to clearly understand the gravity of their work and to selectively utilize well-established methodologies in the practice of knowledge-related activities. This paper serves as an introduction to an application of critical system thinking and total systems intervention in diversified human knowledge topics.

Beginning with a summary of the key influences in the development of the author's own understanding of systems, the paper continues with an overview of developments in the broad variety of disciplinary fields that contributed to the elaboration of systems concepts. Following these introductory reflections, the paper provides a brief discussion of the primary concerns of the original founders of the ISSS (Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Ralph Gerard, James G. Miller and Anatol Rapoport). Those who attended the conference were then asked to consider the evolution of their own understanding of the meaning and significance of systems thinking by responding to the following questions: (1) Through what academic discipline or occupational field were you originally introduced to systems ideas? (2) Which systems thinkers have been most influential in the evolution of your own thinking about systems? (3) What kinds of questions motivated your interest in systems? (4) What kinds of problems were you seeking to address? (5) Has your concern with systems ideas been primarily theoretical or practical? A brief summary of answers to these questions is included in the concluding remarks.

Systems thinking requires conceiving of management dilemmas as arising from within a system with interdependent elements, subsystems, and networks of relationships and patterns of interaction. Taking a systems approach and coupling it with moral imagination, now engaged on the organizational and systemic as well as individual levels of decision-making, I shall conclude, is a methodology that encourages managers and companies to think more imaginatively and to engage in integrating moral decision-making into ordinary business decisions. More importantly this sort of thinking is a means to circumvent what often appear to be intractable problems created by systemic constraints for which no individual appears to be responsible.","Univ Virginia, Darden Sch, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Werhane, PH (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Darden Sch, 100 Darden Blvd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,"Emanuel LL, 2000, CAMB Q HEALTHC ETHIC, V9, P151; Bornstein D., 1996, PRICE DREAM; CUNNINGHAM B, 1999, E0162 UVA DARD SCH C; FREEMAN RE, 1999, ETHICAL ISSUES BUSIN, P247; FRENCH PA, 1979, AM PHILOS QUART, V16, P207; Gentner D., 1997, ENV ETHICS BEHAV; Gorman M., 1992, SIMULATING SCI; Johnson M., 1993, MORAL IMAGINATION; LASZLO A, 1998, SYSTEMS THEORIES PRI, P47; Mitroff I., 1993, UNBOUNDED MIND; Moberg D., 2000, BUSINESS ETHICS Q, V10, P845, DOI 10.2307/3857836; Neufeldt V., 1997, WEBSTERS NEW WORLD C; RAMO S, 1969, CURE CHAOS; Senge P.

Its viewpoint is that deep organisational learning only takes place when the business systems' stakeholders reflect on their actions and thus inquire about their purpose(s) in relation to the business system and the other stakeholders they perceive to exist. This is done by reflecting both on the sources of motivation and/or deception that are contained in their purpose, and also on the sources of collective motivation and/or deception that are contained in the business system's purpose. The development of an organisational information system that captures, manages and institutionalises meaningful information-a knowledge management system-cannot be separated from organisational learning practices, since it should be the result of these very practices. Although Senge's five disciplines provide a useful starting-point in looking at organisational learning, we argue for a critical systems approach, instead of an uncritical Systems Dynamics one that concentrates only on the organisational learning practices. We proceed to outline a methodology called Business Systems Purpose Analysis (BSPA) that offers a participatory structure for team and organisational learning, upon which the stakeholders can take legitimate action that is based on the force of the better argument. In addition, the organisational learning process in BSPA leads to the development of an intrinsically motivated information organisational system that allows for the institutionalisation of the learning process itself in the form of an organisational knowledge management system. This could be a specific application, or something as wide-ranging as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. Examples of the use of BSPA in two ERP implementations are presented.","Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; Deloitte & Touche, Athens, Greece","Edwards, JS (reprint author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Aston Triangle, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",,,"Edwards, John S./0000-0003-3979-017X",,,"Ackoff R.

However, despite strong growth in demand, providers continue to have difficulty achieving profitability, customer churn remains high, and network performance continues to draw complaints. We suggest that strategic business planning for network services would benefit from a systems thinking approach that analyzes the feedback effects present in the underlying business process. These feedback loops can be complex and have significant impact on business performance. For instance, while the size of a provider's customer base depends on price and network performance, network performance is itself dependent on the size of the customer base. In this paper, we develop a planning model that represents these feedback effects using the finite difference equations methodology of systems dynamics. The model is validated by showing its fit with essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain, and by showing its ability to replicate observed reference mode behaviors. Simulations are then carried out under a variety of scenarios to examine issues important to service providers. Among other findings, the simulations suggest that (a) under flat-rate pricing, lowering price to increase customer base can hurt profitability as well as network performance; (b) under usage-based pricing, lowering price need not necessarily lead to a larger customer base; and (c) in addition to price, the customers' threshold of tolerance for performance degradation plays a significant role in balancing market share with profitability. We briefly present a prototype decision support system based on the systems thinking approach, and suggest ways in which it could be used to help business planning for network services.","George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Dutta, A (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Sch Management, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,"ANANIA L, 1998, INTERNET EC, P91; Keeney RL, 1999, MANAGE SCI, V45, P533, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.45.4.533; [Anonymous], 1996, P 1996 WINT SIM C SA, DOI 10.1145/256562.256882; BARRET A, 1997, BUSINESS WEEK   0224, V37; Bolton R.N., 1998, MARKET SCI, V17, P46; Boucher J.R, 1993, TRAFFIC SYSTEM DESIG; BUCHOLTZ C, 1998, TELEPHONY, V234, P58; BURDEN K, 1998, COMPUTERWORLD, V32, P79; DELLCAVE T, 1997, SALES MARKETING 0305; FATTAH H, 1998, MC TECH MARKETING IN, V18, P20; FIRDMAN E, 1997, DATA COMM, V26, P27; FLYNN LJ, 1997, NY TIMES        0325; FONSECA B, 1999, INFOWORLD, V21, P28; Forrester J.W., 1961, IND DYNAMICS; GAGNE C, 1998, COMPUTERWORLD, V32, P79; GOODMAN MR, 1974, STUDY NOTES SYSTEMS; Green H, 1998, BUS WEEK, P114; HAMBLEN M, 1998, COMPUTERWORLD, V32, P120; Hamu DS, 1998, COMMUN ACM, V41, P110, DOI 10.1145/280324.280340; Hauben Michael, 1997, NETIZENS HIST IMPACT; Hoffman DL, 1996, COMMUN ACM, V39, P36, DOI 10.1145/240483.240490; JAMES K, 1997, US TODAY        0131; JAMES K, 1996, US TODAY        1030; Kleinrock Leonard, 1976, QUEUING SYSTEMS, V2; Lange L., 1998, IEEE Spectrum, V35, DOI 10.1109/6.645977; LILIEN GL, 1992, MARKTING MODELS; MACKIEMASON JK, 1998, INTERNET EC, P279; MEHTA M, 1999, PC MAGAZINE, V18, P229; Petrazzini B, 1999, COMMUN ACM, V42, P31, DOI 10.1145/303849.303858; RADOSEVICH L, 1997, INFOWORLD, V19, P1; Rao HR, 1998, COMMUN ACM, V41, P32, DOI 10.1145/272287.272294; Riezenman MJ, 1998, IEEE SPECTRUM, V35, P29, DOI 10.1109/6.645976; Robertazzi T.

Early approaches employing systems ideas, such as operational research, systems analysis and systems engineering, were suitable for tackling certain well-defined problems, but were found to have limitations when faced with complex problems involving people with a variety of viewpoints and frequently at odds with one another. Systems thinkers responded with approaches such as system dynamics and organisational cybernetics to tackle complexity; soft systems methodology (SSM) and interactive planning to handle subjectivity; and critical systems heuristics to help the disadvantaged in situations involving conflict. There was a corresponding enlargement of the range of problem contexts in which they felt competent to intervene. It has been critical systems thinking, however, which has supplied the bigger picture, has allowed systems thinking to mature as a discipline and has set out how the variety of methodologies now available can be used together in a coherent manner to promote successful intervention in complex societal problem situations. This paper outlines, at the request of the editor of this special issue, my involvement in developing critical systems thinking and practice, describes its origins, nature and use, and sets out a programme for future research in the area.

Through courses in the K-12 grades, universities, business schools, and corporations, advocates seek to teach people to think systemically. These courses range from one-day workshops with no mathematics to graduate level courses stressing formal modeling. But how do people learn to think systemically? What skills are required? Does a particular type of academic background improve one's ability to think systemically? What systems concepts are most readily understood? Which tend to be most difficult to grasp? We describe initial results from an assessment tool or systems thinking inventory. The inventory consists of brief tasks designed to assess particular systems thinking concepts such as feedback, delays, and stocks and flows. Initial findings indicate that subjects from an elite business school with essentially no prior exposure to system dynamics concepts have a poor level of understanding of stack and flow relationships and time delays. Performance did not vary systematically with prior education, age, national origin, or other demographic variables. We hope the inventory will eventually provide a means far testing the effectiveness of training and decision aids used to improve systems thinking skills. We discuss the implications of these initial results and explore steps for future research.

A project-oriented enterprise model of batch plants which results of integrating together systems thinking and functional modeling is proposed here. The latter refers to the set of intents and relationships between goals, functions and components (both physical and abstract) that comprise an analytical viewpoint of batch processes involving product recipes, equipment capabilities, constraints and human competencies (skills and knowledge). Complementarily, the systemic perspective accounts for the organizational setting (roles, objectives and actors), and provides an orthogonal view through the duality of whole-parts relationships and the ubiquitous concepts of boundary, emergence and hierarchy upon which the project-oriented enterprise model is built. A case study that comprises a dairy facility involving the production +100 different fresh products using an order-driven management system will be presented. To support the prototype implementation of a plant information system using a hierarchy of project-based objects, a conceptual design has been developed. The implementation of the resulting enterprise model in Project 98(TM) will be discussed to highlight its easy and cheap implementation, and a number of advantages including: accumulation of information and knowledge, direct tracing of activities and cost analysis.

The potential benefits of using CST for ISD are explored, followed by a description of an intervention to derive a design for part of a UK university's IS user support service. More specifically, total systems intervention (TSI) was used as a meta-methodology to operationalize CST and to guide the course of the intervention. The intervention serves as a vehicle to gain insight into the potential value of CST to ISD-related problems, and concludes with reflections on the actual benefits realized and suggestions for further research.","Univ Lincolnshire & Humberside, Lincoln Sch Management, Dept Business Strategy, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England; Univ Hull, Ctr Comp, Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England","Warren, L (reprint author), Univ Lincolnshire & Humberside, Lincoln Sch Management, Dept Business Strategy, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",,,,,,"ADMAN P, 1999, IN PRESS J INFORMATI; Adman P., 1998, Matching Technology with Organisational Needs.

As a researcher, teacher, and author I have addressed this question throughout my professional Life. We discussed this question at the July '97 International Seminar in Systems Thinking in Higher Education at the Open University. This paper is an elaboration of my contribution to the seminar. In Part One, I tell the story of a hypothetical conversation between a subject-matter professor and a systems thinker. It highlights the difference between an instructional-focused and learning-focused approach to education. In Part Two, I elaborate this difference from a systems perspective. In Part Three, I present an epistemology, which brings learning into focus. And, in Part Four, I introduce an image of a systems complex that manifests a shift from instructional to learning focused education.

In itself, the industry contains a myriad of factors and activities which are inter-dependent. In addition, there are two-way relationships to economic, social, environmental and policy factors at various spatial levels. In collaboration with the tourism industry, CSIRO has established the Tourism Futures Project which aims to develop an innovative framework for evaluating the benefits and impacts of nature-based tourism and the policy options for managing tourism activity and development. The case study area comprises Douglas Shire in Northern Queensland and the Calms section of the Great Barrier Reef. This paper describes the progress in developing this framework for mapping and summarizing key social, economic and environmental outcomes of various development scenarios in annual steps to the year 2020.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM To improve supervision of residents' building and managing doctor-patient relationships. MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM Using a program based on systems thinking, the teachers at one Quebec university introduced major changes: a reduction in the number of doctors involved in supervision; a common conceptual framework enabling supervisors to more adequately observe, analyse, evaluate, and discuss the doctor-patient relationship; and peer supervision (metasupervision). CONCLUSION The key to acceptance of these changes was the approach used: consultation, team work, and the development of a new culture.

The need for and advantages of controlled experimental research on the effects of interventions on mental models and cognitive processes, as well as the limitations of current assessment practices, are discussed. An agenda for collaborative research between cognitive psychologists and researchers interested in dynamic systems, covering the areas of memory, analogical transfer, mental models, decision processes, human-computer interaction, and expertise, is outlined in detail. The article concludes with a discussion of the difficulties and long-term advantages of conducting the described research.

The overall context of the project focuses on integration of mental health and vocational rehabilitation services. The experiment is designed to evaluate measurable outcomes, including shifts in goal structures and change strategies of the management team, shifts in relative alignment of the management team as a whole, perceived success of the intervention, and changes in systems and procedures necessary to improve client services.

However, little is known about the efficacy of these interventions in enhancing organizational effectiveness or productivity. With few exceptions, the relationship between the use of systems thinking and organizational performance remains the province of anecdote rather than rigorous follow-up research. Evaluation helps identify the tools and techniques that can be used successfully, the situations in which they work, and their limitations. This article reports a follow-up evaluation of a well known systems thinking intervention designed to improve quality and performance in the claims adjusting unit of a U.S. insurance firm. Through a questionnaire, interviews, and extensive review of company records, it has been established that the intervention succeeded in changing the mental models and behavior of key managers. New policies consistent with model recommendations were implemented. Evidence of performance improvement is mixed, however. A number of confounding variables limit the possibility of assessing the business impact of the intervention. These limitations could have been lessened if the original intervention had been designed with rigious evaluations as a goal. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Syst. Dyn.

Each of these theories and ways of practising systems science has legitimate claims for its ability to handle certain kinds of systems problems. Dealing with this diversity can be seen as a critical issue for systems thinking and practice. One approach to handling this rich diversity has been to attempt to capture it in frameworks which align features and positions in a ''complementarist'' fashion. By reviewing work undertaken by systems thinkers who have advocated such a stance, it will be demonstrated that complementarism has its faults, and can be perceived as an imperialist strategy. A route out of the impasse will be suggested through the use of a form of discordant pluralism, which, if taken up, has the potential for bringing together conflicting perspectives in a new constellation.",,"Gregory, WJ (reprint author), UNIV HULL,DEPT MANAGEMENT SYST & SCI,COTTINGHAM RD,KINGSTON HULL HU6 7RX,N HUMBERSIDE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,"ADORNO T, 1977, AESHTETICS POLITICS; JACKSON MC, 1990, J OPER RES SOC, V41, P657; FLOOD RL, 1990, HUM RELAT, V43, P49, DOI 10.1177/001872679004300104; Bernstein R., 1983, OBJECTIVISM RELATIVI; Bernstein R.

This is an appropriate time for appraisal, and this is the first in a series of articles which will make such an appraisal of the approach. After investigating the kind of knowledge articulated in an SSM study in terms of the categories 'knowing-how', 'knowing-that', but also 'knowing-from-within', the explicit or implicit 'dividing line' in the various representations of the methodology are re-examined. This line, in the original representation of the methodology, separated the real world of the problem situation ('above the line') and the consciously-organized systems thinking world ('below the line'). It is argued that this divide, initially helpful in drawing attention to the conscious use of systems thinking to explore real-world complexity, can be taken to indicate a false dualism; it is necessary to move beyond it if we are to make sense of contemporary sophisticated uses of SSM.","UNIV LANCASTER,SCH MANAGEMENT,DEPT MANAGEMENT SCI,LANCASTER LA1 4YX,ENGLAND","Tsouvalis, C (reprint author), UNIV HUMBERSIDE,CTR SYST & INFORMAT SCI,KINGSTON HULL HU6 7RT,N HUMBERSIDE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,"Ayer A.

As an example, a set of models for strategic decision support in Swiss nuclear energy policy issues is developed centring on the increase of nuclear production capacity and a final storage for nuclear wastes, First, a systems thinking approach is used to define a coherent, comprehensive framework focusing on the sociopolitical mechanisms at work. Second, metagame analysis concentrates on the conflict resolution process between the opposed groups, When decisions are made and implemented the interactions between the actors involved are critical for their behaviour in the subsequent phase. Here, the models show how their strategic efforts evolve over time.

This comparison proves favourable to the systems approach which, with its carefully crafted foundations, seems to offer much more to managers than the fads.

This article reviews the development of systems thinking and focuses on one of the systems approaches: Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). It indicates how SSM embodies systems thinking by giving an account of the crucial steps in the thinking as SSM developed. Issues in current work are reviewed by setting out a number of experientially derived generalizations. These concern: SSM as an ideal-type process that the user suitably adapts on each occasion of use; the fact that SSM's systemicity lies primarily in the process of inquiry; the fact that its focus is the interaction between theory and practice; the implicit belief behind SSM that learning is axiomatically good; and the belief that SSM is best used participatively.,,"CHECKLAND, PB (reprint author), UNIV LANCASTER,DEPT MANAGEMENT SCI,ACT RES PROGRAM,LANCASTER LA1 4YX,ENGLAND.",,,,,,"CHECKLAND P, 1983, J OPER RES SOC, V34, P661, DOI 10.2307/2581700; Avison D.E., 1990, MULTIVIEW EXPLORATIO; Checkland P.

I argue that systems thinking is currently failing to make the most of the significant steps forward taken in the discipline during the 1970s and 1980s. Systems thinking should be able to present itself as the discipline capable of offering a holistic response to a very wide range of management problems. Instead, different groupings of academics and practitioners lay claim to the systems label but share little overall intellectual vision. While the discipline remains fragmented, the claim to offer a holistic and comprehensive response to management problems will seem hollow.

Case studies, systems thinking, and soft OR usually lack the discipline of explicit model creation and simulation and so rely on subjective use of unreliable intuition for evaluating the complex structures that emerge from the initial description of the real system. Nevertheless, systems thinking and soft OR, with emphasis on eliciting information from real-world participants, should contribute useful insights to system dynamics.

If learning occurs through experience, there are good reasons why organizations often fail to learn. In particular, large organizations face a class of systemic decision-making situations in which learning is extremely unlikely. The systems perspective teaches us that cause and effect are often not close in time and space, that obvious interventions do not always produce obvious outcomes, and that long time delays, and systemic effects of actions can make it almost impossible to judge the effectiveness of those actions. This article presents a frame-work for organizational learning, outlines several breakdowns that thwart the learning process, and discusses how systems thinking can play an important role in helping organizations overcome the learning breakdowns through the design and implementation of managerial practice fields.","MIT,CTR ORG MANAGEMENT,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139","KIM, DH (reprint author), MIT,ALFRED P SLOAN SCH MANAGEMENT,E40-294,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139, USA.",,"Kumar, Ajit/J-1617-2015","Kumar, Ajit/0000-0003-3255-5054",,,"Ackoff R.

This interest has resulted from attempts to overcome the recognized deficiencies of conventional computer systems analysis methods and techniques. A particular problem which has received attention over the past 5 years is the epistemological and operational differences between the investigative process of the pre-design stage and the technological specification. We suggest that this argument is somewhat unproductive and advocate a necessary rethinking about the nature of information systems and the use of technology to support their activities. A re-evaluation of the way that we set about designing computer-based information systems suggests that many of the problems of conventional systems analysis methods may be alleviated by an approach that allows the 'client', or 'user', to have a greater control over the identification, specification and development of their information system(s). The authors' belief in this course of action has led to the development of client-led design as an underpinning philosophy for user participation in the design of computer-based information systems. Client-led design draws upon and develops concepts and tools from 'interpretive', or 'soft', systems thinking and, in particular, can be seen as providing a framework for the type of subjective inquiry that Checkland & Scholes (1990) referred to as 'ideal-type' mode 2 SSM. This paper is related to the papers published in the Journal of Information Systems (Vol. 3, No. 3), which was a special edition to illustrate the influence of 'soft' systems thinking upon information systems design and development.","[Stowell, F.

While the web of interdependencies tightens, our capacity for thinking in terms of dynamic interdependencies has not kept pace. As the gap between the nature of our problems and the ability to understand them grows, we face increasing perils on a multitude of fronts. Systems thinking and one of its subsets-system dynamics-are important for developing effective strategies to close this gap. Unfortunately, system dynamicists and systems thinkers have not effectively taught their framework, skills, and technologies to others. The door has not been opened wide enough to let others share our insights with respect to the workings of closed-loop systems. To transfer this understanding on a broad scale, we need a clearer view of its nature and of the education system into which it must be transferred. This article casts some light on what we have to bestow and on the education system that is to receive our bounty.

But local decision making and individual autonomy lead to management anarchy unless managers account for the interconnections and long-term side-effects of their local decisions. Laudable goals such as 'empowering' and 'enabling' individuals often prove counterproductive unless managers can act locally and think globally. Managers must become 'systems thinkers' as well as better learners. This paper reports on one approach to these issues: forming collaborative action research partnerships with corporations to 1) develop new tools to accelerate learning, and 2) test those tools in real organizations where managers face pressing issues. We argue that simulation is an important element of successful learning laboratories to develop systems thinking and promote organizational learning.

A new type of visual facilitation is described using hexagons as a flexible mapping technique to bridge the gap between thoughts and models. A typical team application is described and a link is also made to creative thinking techniques, including the use of cognitive colour-coding. These techniques are supported by new use of magnetic hardware and a specially designed mapping software. In conclusion, the idea of the transitional discipline is introduced as a way in which a variety of specialist decision support methods can be made more user friendly.",,"HODGSON, AM (reprint author), IDON LTD,EDRADOUR HOUSE,PITLOCHRY PH16 5JW,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,"Adams J., 1986, CONCEPTUAL BLOCKBUST, V3rd; MILLER GA, 1956, PSYCHOL REV, V63, P81, DOI 10.1037//0033-295X.101.2.343; De Bono E., 1990, I AM RIGHT YOU ARE W; de Bono E., 1986, 6 THINKING HATS; de Geus A., 1988, HARVARD BUSINESS MAR, P70; Flores F., 1986, UNDERSTANDING COMPUT; Friend J.

Technological innovations based on the propositions generated through this paradigm have played a profound role in the extraordinary productivity growth that has occurred in agriculture across the globe. Yet with recognition of its success in this context is the realization of its inadequacies from broader perspectives. There is an increasing sense of unease about degradation of biophysical environments, distortions of socio-economic environments, and dislocations of cultural environments too often associated with agricultural practices. There are calls for a new science and praxis of complexity to deal with these problematic relationships between agriculture and the environments in which it is conducted. Systems thinking and practices are emerging as useful in this regard. Two schools are apparent within this broad movement. The first (""hard"") approach comes from a pedigree that includes systems analysis, systems engineering, cybernetics, and ecosystem biology. Assuming a world of transforming systems, the ""hard"" systems scientists in agriculture seek to design new agro-ecosystems that are at once productive, stable, equitable, and sustainable. In the ""soft"" approach, with its foundation in cognitive science, the systemicity is transferred from the world to the way of investigating the world. This new paradigm presents considerable challenge to conventional methods and methodologies in research, education, and extension in contemporary agriculture.",,"BAWDEN, RJ (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN SYDNEY,HAWKESBURY AGR COLL,RICHMOND,NSW 2753,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,"VAYDA AP, 1975, ANNU REV ANTHROPOL, V4, P293, DOI 10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453; ATKINSON CJ, 1989, J APPL SYSTEMS ANAL, V16, P43; Bateson G., 1971, STEPS ECOLOGY MIND; Bawden R., 1990, AGR SYSTEMS SYSTEMS; BAWDEN RJ, 1990, PURPOSES FIELD CROP; BAWDEN RJ, 1989, ACTION RES SYSTEMS A; BAWDEN RJ, 1984, AGR SYST, V13, P205, DOI 10.1016/0308-521X(84)90074-X; BONNEN JT, 1983, AM J AGR ECON, V65, P958, DOI 10.2307/1240399; Brouwer R., 1989, SYSTEMS PRACTICE, V2, P379, DOI 10.1007/BF01062322; Bruner JS, 1966, KNOWING ESSAYS LEFT; BUTTEL FH, 1985, AGR HUMAN VALUES, V2, P78, DOI 10.1007/BF01530555; BYERLEE D, 1982, AM J AGR ECON, V64, P897, DOI 10.2307/1240753; CHAMBERS R, 1983, RURAL DEV PUTTING LA; Checkland P, 1984, SYSTEMS THINKING SYS; Checkland P.
